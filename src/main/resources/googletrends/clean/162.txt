<p> Boujee

<p> unknown

<p> An abbreviation of the French "

<p> bourgeois

<p> ." A critical term used to describe people, things, and places that are definitively high-class. Something that is affected,

<p> inauthentic

<p> ,

<p> gentrified

<p> , exclusive, and/or otherwise sheltered from the dirt and grime of the real world.

<p> Example 1:

<p> Dick: Wanna go into the city?

<p> Jane: Yeah, I've gotta get out of this boujee town. It's become so gentrified ever since the new

<p> homeowner's association

<p> plowed on in. Let's get some tacos from that dude at the corner of Market and 6th.

<p> Example 2:

<p> Kate Spade: Let us go in my dad's

<p> Ford Explorer

<p> to the Whole Foods/Andronico's/Trader Joe's/(place your pretentious grocer here) on the way home from the symphony.

<p> Jordan

<p> Catalano

<p> : Yeah right, Kate Spade. I'd rather ride my bike to corner store/farmer's market/etc instead of supporting the overhead of that boujee place.
