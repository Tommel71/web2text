<p> 'The Good Doctor' Season 2 Trailer Hints at a New Reality for Shaun

<p> Freddie Highmore's Dr. Shaun Murphy will face the consequences of his slip-up in the first-season finale when the ABC drama returns.

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> ended its first season with two major revelations: that Dr. Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff) has cancer and that, distracted by the news about his mentor, Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) made a major mistake in a surgery.

<p> Murphy may also be in for a rougher time with Andrews apparently taking leadership of the hospital and cutting the young resident no slack. "I was honest; it just made it worse," Murphy says in the trailer.

<p> Highmore, who recently signed an

<p> overall deal

<p> with

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> producer Sony, wrote the season two premiere and is in line to direct an episode later this season. In the episode, Murphy's proposed treatment for a homeless patient puts him and Jared (Chuku Modu) in Andrews' crosshairs.
