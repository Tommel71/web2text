<p> The battle advisors are VERY surprising, to say the least ...

<p> With

<p> a new season

<p> of

<p> The Voice

<p> (premiering September 24, on NBC at 8 p.m. ET) comes a whole new squad of coaches and "battle advisors" for the competition. While

<p> Kelly Clarkson

<p> , Blake Shelton, and

<p> Adam Levine

<p> are all returning to judge the competition, Alicia Keys will not be ... which means

<p> one

<p> red chair is getting a fresh face. And that's not the only change happening.

<p> Here, a confirmed list of the key (and new!) players that'll definitely be on season 15:

<p> 1

<p> Kelly Clarkson: Coach

<p> Kelly

<p> is definitely returning for her second season on

<p> The Voice.

<p> Long before joining the show,

<p> Kelly

<p> won the very first season of

<p> American Idol

<p> back in 2002. From then on, her music career has soared. The 36-year-old artist has released eight albums and earned three Grammys, four American Music awards, and 13 Billboard Music awards.

<p> At

<p> The Voice

<p> , Kelly has already proven herself

<p> a very worthy competitor. Kelly picked season 14's winner Brynn Cartelli for her very first season. Bottom line: Blake and Adam — who have been on the show since the very beginning — better watch out.

<p> 2

<p> Blake Shelton: Coach

<p> Despite constantly hitting the road for various

<p> country music tours

<p> ,

<p> People

<p> 's "Sexiest Man Alive" of 2017 has always found time to coach talent on

<p> The Voice

<p> . This season marks seven years on the show for

<p> Blake

<p> (which also means seven whole years of bickering with Adam). The country singer started off as a hopeful artist in Nashville and eventually got noticed and signed to Giant Records in 2001. Soon, he was landing on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts and snagging Grammy nominations and Country Music awards. Besides

<p> The Voice

<p> , Blake has appeared on singing competitions

<p> Nashville Star

<p> and

<p> Clash of the Choirs

<p> over the years. His role on

<p> The Voice

<p> is arguably his most notable one, though, especially since his team has won a whopping six times (the best coaching record in

<p> Voice

<p> history).

<p> 3

<p> Jennifer Hudson: Coach

<p> Jennifer was previously a coach on season 13 and was on

<p> The Voice U.K

<p> .

<p> last season. There, she became the first female coach to win the U.K. version of the show. Before all of that though, Jennifer got her big break as a finalist on the third season of

<p> American Idol

<p> in 2004

<p> .

<p> In addition to her singing talents (which have earned her two Grammys), Jennifer has been recognized for her acting skills. She earned an Oscar for her supporting role in 2006's

<p> Dreamgirls

<p> and starred as Shug Avery on Broadway in

<p> The Color Purple

<p> . With so many accomplishments already under her belt, we're sure she's hoping to add winning

<p> The Voice

<p> season 15 to her resume.

<p> 4

<p> Adam Levine: Coach

<p> Like his "nemesis" Blake,

<p> Adam

<p> is entering his 15th season with the show. So far, Team Adam has clinched three victories (second behind Blake). In between his coaching gig, Adam has been plenty busy acting on shows like FX's

<p> American Horror Story

<p> , winning three Grammys, three American Music awards, four Billboard Music Awards, and an MTV Video Music award. His career launched back in 1994, when he helped start the band Kara's Flowers. The group eventually became Maroon 5.

<p> 5

<p> Carson Daly: Host

<p> Even though

<p> Carson

<p> has briefly been joined by Alison Haislip and Christina Milian, the NBC native is the only host who has stuck around for all 15 seasons of

<p> The Voice

<p> . He's also taken on a producing role with the show, which has earned him four Emmys for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program. How did he earn such an award-winning gig? Prior to the singing competition, he appeared on

<p> MTV's

<p> TRL

<p> for five years and he has experience hosting

<p> New Year's Eve with Carson Daly

<p> . While at

<p> The Voice

<p> , he also took on the role of social media reporter at

<p> Today

<p> . Safe to say, he's definitely a big deal in the world of TV hosts.

<p> 6

<p> CeeLo Green: Battle Advisor for Team Adam

<p> In CeeLo's early days as a singer and rapper, CeeLo belonged to the group Gnarls Barkley; their song "Crazy" topped the charts worldwide in 2006. In 2010, CeeLo went solo with his single "F--k You!," along with the radio-version

<p> "Forget You,"

<p> which, again, gained popularity all over the globe. One year later, he joined

<p> The Voice

<p> as one of the first judges on the show and stayed on for four seasons. Like his fellow coaches Kelly and Adam, he has collected a total of three Grammys so far. Fast forward to now, the soul singer is making a return to the show to work with Adam's vocalists in hopes of bringing home another victory for the Maroon 5 singer's team.

<p> 7

<p> Keith Urban: Battle Advisor for Team Blake

<p> Years after Keith Urban bid farewell to his four-season judging stint on

<p> American Idol

<p> , the country superstar has decided to give

<p> The Voice

<p> a go to help out his buddy Blake. Keith's accolades are endless. After a few early '90s projects collaborating with the likes of

<p> Alan Jackson

<p> and

<p> Paul Jefferson

<p> , things really took off for Keith after he released his

<p> self-titled 1999 album

<p> . All in all, his success has landed him four Grammys, 10 Country Music Association Awards, and even a Golden Globe nomination for his song "For You" from the 2012 film

<p> Act of Valor

<p> .

<p> 8

<p> Halsey: Battle Advisor for Jennifer Hudson

<p> Ashley Nicolette Frangipane, professionally known as Halsey, will be teaming up with Jennifer to whip her team into shape. Halsey made her

<p> Voice

<p> debut last season when

<p> she and Big Sean performed "Alone"

<p> for the show's finale. The artist rose to fame after a few of her Youtube covers went viral, leading to the SoundCloud original "Ghost" that exploded overnight. The next day, she

<p> reportedly

<p> was asked to attend six different label meetings. Halsey is a relative newcomer to the music scene. She has toured with

<p> Imagine Dragons

<p> and collaborated with

<p> The Chainsmokers

<p> on their 2016 hit "Closer."

<p> 9

<p> Thomas Rhett: Battle Advisor for Team Kelly

<p> To help Kelly, country singer Thomas will be judging alongside her, offering his advice on what it takes to become a master performer. Music is in Thomas' genes: His dad, "Don't Get Me Started" singer Rhett Akins is a bonafide country music superstar. In 2013, Thomas scored his

<p> first number-one hit

<p> with "It Goes Like This." Since then, he's had eight singles fly to the top of the charts and has embarked on headlining tours with

<p> Brett Eldredge

<p> ,

<p> Jason Aldean

<p> , and more.
