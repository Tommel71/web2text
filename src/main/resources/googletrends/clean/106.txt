<p> Steps

<p> 1

<p> Mix cold water and salt in a large clean bucket or stockpot (noncorrosive); stir until salt is dissolved. Add turkey. Cover and refrigerate 8 to 12 hours.

<p> 2

<p> Heat oven to 325°F. Remove turkey from brine; discard brine. Thoroughly rinse turkey under cool running water, gently rubbing outside and inside of turkey to release salt. Pat skin and both interior cavities dry with paper towels.

<p> 3

<p> Fasten neck skin to back of turkey with skewer. Fold wings across back of turkey so tips are touching. Toss onion, carrot, celery and thyme with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter; place in turkey cavity.

<p> 4

<p> Place turkey, breast side down, on rack in large shallow roasting pan. Brush entire back side of turkey with 1 tablespoon melted butter. Turn turkey over. Brush entire breast side of turkey with remaining 1 tablespoon melted butter. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is in thickest part of inside thigh and does not touch bone. (Do not add water or cover turkey.)

<p> 5

<p> Roast uncovered 3 hours 30 minutes to 4 hours, brushing twice with pan drippings during last 30 minutes of roasting.

<p> 6

<p> Turkey is done when thermometer reads 165°F and drumsticks move easily when lifted or twisted. If a meat thermometer is not used, begin testing for doneness after about 3 hours. When turkey is done, place on warm platter and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Let stand about 15 minutes for easiest carving.

<p> Expert Tips

<p> Turkey can be brined a day ahead. Rinse well, cover and refrigerate until time to roast.

<p> Frozen turkey tastes just as good as fresh and is easily available at any supermarket. Just remember to allow enough time for thawing, since the turkey must be completely thawed before brining. To thaw this size of whole turkey, place the turkey (in its original wrap) in a pan in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

<p> More About This Recipe

<p> This recipe is for those of you who could take or leave turkey. (No, it’s not blasphemy to be on the fence about this bird.) The enormous size of a turkey makes it a considerable challenge to cook correctly. To get the whole bird done, some parts, like the breast, end up getting cooked too long resulting in dry meat, which is precisely what so many people find off-putting about turkey. Luckily, there’s a way around this, and it’s called brining. Brining is a way to prepare your meat, so it turns out succulent and tender. It can be done two different ways with a wet brine, as this recipe calls for, or with a dry brine. When you wet brine a turkey, it means you immerse it in a salty liquid, a brine, for an extended period — in this case, 8 to 12 hours. The salty brine breaks down the tissue of the meat, which leads to better texture and flavor. So this Thanksgiving, roasting a brined turkey is the way to convert even the skeptics into turkey lovers! Just remember that if you start from frozen, you’ll need a few days to both thaw and brine your turkey. Refer to our handy
