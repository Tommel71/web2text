<p> Say hello to a new coach this year!

<p> The heat of August might have you still in

<p> full summer mode

<p> , but fall is only a few weeks away. And with it comes another season of

<p> NBC's hit

<p> The Voice

<p> .

<p> While the format of the competition show will overall stay the same, the series is once again shaking things up in the judges (officially known as coaches) row. Here are all the key details about the new season that we know so far:

<p> The Voice

<p> season 15 stars Monday, September 24 at 8 p.m.

<p> Warning you now: Monday, September 24 is going to be all about the TV premieres. Apart from

<p> The Voic

<p> e

<p> coming back on NBC,

<p> The Big Bang Theory

<p> (CBS),

<p> Young Sheldon

<p> (CBS), and

<p> Dancing With the Stars

<p> (ABC) all return that same night (and, unfortunately all right around the same time). Your DVR will be your lifesaver that night, so better hop to

<p> buying one

<p> if you're without.

<p> The show will air two times a week.

<p> As with previous seasons, the reality singing competition will air both on Monday and Tuesday nights following the premiere on September 24.

<p> First, the coaches will select their team of artists during the "Blind Auditions" round. Next, two performers from the same team will go head-to-head, while coaches are only allowed to pick one to go to the next round. The third part, also known as "The Knockouts," again pit teammates against one another, though this time the singer gets to make their own song selection. Then come "The Playoffs," where the top 20 compete to secure a spot on the live shows. Finally, the top 12 artists battle it out live each week until the public chooses one winner of

<p> The Voice

<p> .

<p> The Voice

<p> coaches are changing ... sort of.

<p> Don't panic, Blake Shelton/

<p> Adam Levine fans

<p> . The famous Blake-Adam rivalry isn't going anywhere. Translation: Get ready for even more hilarious jabs.

<p> "You're such a nerd. You look like you're wearing a pair of jeans that buttons up at your neck," Adam shouts at Blake in

<p> an exclusive preview clip on

<p> ET

<p> of the upcoming season. "You're wearing a Canadian tuxedo!"

<p> Blake and Adam aside, joining the row of red swivel chairs is

<p> American Idol

<p> star Jennifer Hudson. She will be next to her longtime pal

<p> Kelly Clarkson

<p> to round out the coaching panel for season 15. Jennifer had previously served as a coach back in season 13 and was on

<p> The Voice UK

<p> last season.

<p> By the sounds of it, she's pretty amped about coming back:

<p> And there's a fifth coach!

<p> For the first time ever, the show has a fifth coach, and it's none other than country singer Kelsea Ballerini. But she won't be on stage with the rest of the crew. She'll be featured in a new online series called the Comeback Stage, where she will coach six artist who weren't chosen for the main show but have some serious talent. Then, out of that group, one will be picked to compete in the live shows.

<p> Host Carson Daly is returning.

<p> The

<p> TODAY

<p> star confirmed his spot back as lead host

<p> with a recent retweet

<p> and Instagram. Just like coaches Blake and Adam, Carson has been with

<p> The Voice

<p> since it's inaugural season back in 2011. He was briefly joined by Alison Haislip and Christina Milian, but today is the show's only host.

<p> Each coach will have one "block button" to use.

<p> Despite

<p> varying opinions

<p> about it, the "block button" is here to stay,

<p> ET

<p> confirms. Just like in season 14, each coach will have the ability to employ a "block," which means they can stop another coach from getting an artist to join their team.

<p> Of course, the "block" twist adds a bit more fun and a dramatic element to the show. But

<p> many

<p> believe it's

<p> not really fair to the contestants

<p> and results in some singers not choosing their mentors. Nevertheless, it's for sure coming back, so coaches better be on their toes and choose to use it wisely.

<p> Keith Urban and Thomas Rhett are joining as battle advisors for the coaches.

<p> Besides

<p> Blake Shelton

<p> ,

<p> The Voice

<p> is getting even more of country music influence during the "Battle Rounds" of the competition. To help out the "Honey Bee" singer,

<p> Keith Urban

<p> will serve as a celebrity advisor on his team. Meanwhile, Kelly is reportedly getting Thomas Rhett as a helping hand with her team of 12 artists.

<p> This marks the first time Thomas has been tapped by

<p> The Voice

<p> (or by any major reality competition show, for that matter) to be a coach. You might remember that

<p> Keith once appeared

<p> as a

<p> judge on

<p> American Idol

<p> .

<p> CeeLo Green and Halsey will also offer their advice.

<p> Country singers aren't the only ones who get to lend their expertise in season 15. Joining Team Adam will be former full-time coach CeeLo Green. After starting as one of the show's first coaches, CeeLo announced that he would not be returning to the show in February 2014.

<p> Jennifer will welcome Halsey to her team as an advisor. The singer/songwriter performed alongside Jason Aldean, Big Sean, Florence + the Machine, and Dua Lipa for the season 14 finale.

<p> Watch season 15 of

<p> The Voice

<p> on NBC starting Monday, September 24 at 8 p.m. ET.
