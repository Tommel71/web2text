<p> Matt Lauer

<p> , who was accused of

<p> sexual harassment

<p> and fired from NBC in 2017, thinks he’s going to be back on television sometime soon. According to “Page Six,” Lauer was dining at a restaurant in New York City when he told fans that he would be in front of cameras again soon.

<p> “I’ve been busy being a dad,” Lauer reportedly said. “But don’t worry, I’ll be back on TV.”

<p> When Lauer was

<p> fired from NBC

<p> , the network attempted to

<p> erase all traces

<p> of the former host, going so far as to demolish his office. It is safe to assume that he won’t be making any possible comeback at 30 Rock.

<p> Lauer hasn’t divulged exact details of his return to television, but this isn’t the first time there have been rumors of his return. Earlier in the year,

<p> reports surfaced

<p> that he was meeting with producers. He is one of many men revealed by the #MeToo movement as sexual predators to

<p> attempt to make a return

<p> to the public sphere.

<p> Charlie Rose

<p> ,

<p> Louis C.K.

<p> , and

<p> Lorin Stein

<p> have all reportedly sought avenues back into their former careers.
