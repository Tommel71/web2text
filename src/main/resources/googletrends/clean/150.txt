<p> S

<p> torm-shocked Floridians returned to shattered homes on Monday as the remnants of Hurricane Irma pushed inland, leaving more than half of all state residents without power and city streets underwater from Orlando and Jacksonville into coastal Georgia and South Carolina.

<p> Downgraded to a tropical storm early on Monday, Irma had ranked as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record before barrelling into the Florida Keys on Sunday and plowing northward along the Gulf Coast and moving inland to wreak havoc across a wide swath of the third-most populous US state.

<p> Still, the scope of damage in Florida and neighboring states paled in comparison with the utter devastation left by Irma as a rare Category 5 hurricane in parts of the Caribbean, where the storm killed nearly 40 people - at least 10 of them in Cuba - before turning its fury on Florida.

<p> ix deaths in the state have been blamed on Irma, along with three in Georgia and one in South Carolina. At least 35 people were killed in the Caribbean.

<p> T

<p> he White House warned it could take weeks before electricity is fully restored.

<p> Boats lay partly submerged and petrol stations had roofs blown off. Several deaths were reported in traffic accidents.

<p> Returning residents consoled each other as some found their houses damaged and lawns turned into lakes.

<p> There was some relief in Miami that the city was spared

<p> the flooding which devastated Houston

<p> with the city's better drainage system better able to cope with the volume of water.

<p> round three dozen people were arrested for looting, including from sports shops and a gun store, and more than 3,500 flights were cancelled.

<p> Estimates suggested the two recent hurricanes, Irma and Harvey, could together cost the US economy $290 billion.

<p> While Irma was hitting Miami a mother and four-month-old baby were rescued from their flooded home by police in a military vehicle. A police spokesman said: "The water was 3ft high and rising. They were found in waist-high water standing there in a panic."

<p> In Lakeland, Florida police rescued a family with two children, aged six months and 10 months, from a partially submerged car. "The water was up to the car seats," said a spokesman.

<p> before Irma and rescuers went door-to-door looking for many who had stayed behind, especially in the battered Florida Keys.

<p> eorge Ramos, a resident on Summerland Key, said the the sea surged into his garage, leaving fish in his swimming pool and a boat in his back garden. He said: "I have no idea who the boat belongs to. The storm sounded like war. It sounded like explosives.”

<p> Martin Senterfitt, the local emergency director, warned of a “humanitarian crisis" and said "disaster mortuary teams" were being sent in case of deaths.

<p> Roman Gastesi, a local administrator for the Florida Keys, said, "It’s time to rebuild. It’s time to start cleaning up our paradise." The storm was the strongest to hit the Florida Keys since Hurricane Donna in 1960.

<p> On the mainland the hurricane initially sucked water away from beaches. In Sarasota two manatees were left high and dry before residents dragged them back toward the water.

<p> Rescuer Michael Sechler said: "We gave them as much water as we could, hoping the rain and storm surge would come soon enough to save them."

<p> "When Americans are in need, Americans pull together and we are one country." Before reaching Florida the storm had caused at least three dozen deaths in the Caribbean.

<p> The eye of the hurricane went over Tampa Bay - an area home to around three million people that has not suffered such a large hurricane since 1921 - at 2am local time (7am BST) on Monday.

<p> As aerial pictures showing the extent of the damage emerged, Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn said: "What we thought was going to be a punch in the face was a glancing blow."

<p> Main problem: power

<p> T

<p> he general consensus is that Fort Lauderdale dodged a bullet, writes

<p> Rob Crilly

<p> from Florida.

<p> Rather than a category four storm smashing up the east coast, it had to contend with feeder bands of much lesser force. Today things have been getting back to normal.

<p> For people like Craig and Debbie Mayor the main problem now is power. Their fortified house - with sturdy storm windows and shutters - came through unscathed, but they have had no mains electricity since Sunday morning. Their hurricane routine, however, runs like clockwork. On Monday night they clubbed together with neighbours for a supper of burgers cooked on the grill and salad. No electricity required. They survived like this for for six weeks in 2005 after Hurricane Wilma, each neighbour cooking up whatever off their food was about to spoil.

<p> Winter Park police spokesman Garvin McComie says officers responded Monday morning following reports of a man lying in the roadway.

<p> The officers determined that 51-year-old Brian Buwalda was dead at the scene. A medical examiner will determine an official cause of death, but McComie says it appears to be an accident.

<p> Winter Park is in Orange County, just of Orlando.

<p> Woman hit by washing machine as Irma battered Tortola

<p> A

<p> resident of an island destroyed by Hurricane Irma has told how she was struck by a washing machine as her house was battered by the storm.

<p> Sarah Penney, a UK citizen who was born and raised on Tortola, said the washer-dryer could have taken her with it as it was lifted off the ground.

<p> The 33-year-old was saved by her friend, who managed to push the appliance away and into the direction of the wind.

<p> She said: "I sincerely would not be alive, I would not have survived Hurricane Irma, had he not been there."

<p> Ms Penney was sheltering with her eight-month-old baby, her mother, 70, and friend, Chouby, at home during the storm when the group were forced to retreat to the bathroom.

<p> Along with her friend, she attempted to secure the nursery as an alternative shelter, but they were stopped when high winds pulled the glass from the windows.

<p> The door of the nursery was sucked shut by the pressure, trapping the pair inside, but they managed to escape when the winds dropped for a moment. Ms Penney said:

<p> "The washer and dryer got lifted and thrown towards me when we were trying to get a piece of wood back up on the door.

<p> "It slammed into me, but it would have taken me if Chouby hadn't been able to be right next to me and just push it so that it got directed into the wind. It's like we've been bombed.

<p> "There isn't a single leaf on a tree, there's no trees. I think humans have fared a lot better than animals. It's going to take a generation to come back from this.

<p> "People's 'everything' is gone, their businesses, their homes, their churches, their schools, are gone."

<p> But Ms Penney, who helped in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake, has chosen to stay behind to help on the ground and is orchestrating "salvage and supply runs".

<p> Ms Penney said: "Most of us need to see this place rebuilt as quickly as it can and that really only happens when those of us who have the know-how and the determination and local knowledge, stay on."

<p> it spent three consecutive days as a top-of-the-scale category five hurricane, the longest in the satellite era

<p> it generated the second most Accumulated Cyclone Energy - a key measurement that combines strength and duration - in the satellite era. Irma generated about as much as energy as entire normal Atlantic hurricane season

<p> Most of the power losses were in Florida, but losses in Georgia, which were at about 90,000, were expected to increase as the storm moved north.

<p> FPL, the biggest power company in Florida, said more than 3.6 million of its customers were without power by 6am (11am BST) on Monday). A total of 4.2 million have been affected, with about 570,000 seeing service restored, mostly by automated devices.

<p> Maximum sustained winds had decreased to nearly 85mph as of 2am local time (7am BST), with Irma projected to become a tropical storm as it moved into northern Florida or southern Georgia later on Monday.

<p> Warnings of dangerous storm surges remained in effect through vast swaths of peninsular Florida, where more than six million people had been ordered to flee Irma in one of the biggest evacuations in US history.
