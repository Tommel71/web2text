<p> The Philadelphia Flyers revealed its new mascot Gritty ??? and he will haunt you for the rest of your foreseeable days.

<p> The scraggly, googly-eyed, orange-haired mascot was made public Monday morning, and looks like the result of an unholy union between the Babadook and a Muppet from Fraggle Rock.

<p> Gritty is probably the last thing anyone needs, or wants to see at any sports arena. But hey, here we are.

<p> Though, perhaps worse than the mascot's appearance is his name. According to the Flyers'

<p> website

<p> , Gritty got his, uh, unique nickname "for possessing an attitude so similar to the team he follows."

<p> That makes sense, I suppose. But the website also contains some additional and somewhat troubling information regarding Gritty's backstory, like the fact that his father was a "bully," he eats ice straight from the Zamboni machine, and has a voracious love of hot dogs.

<p> Really makes you wonder whose job it is to create mascots, and whether or not they're OK.

<p> Naturally, the internet has been having some pretty strong reactions to Gritty's reveal, wavering from frightened to slightly less frightened, calling Gritty both "nightmare fuel" and "an absolute dream haunter."

<p> The sports blog

<p> Crossing Broad

<p> even published an article titled, "The Flyers??? New Mascot Is Here To Murder You." And, honestly, I don't know that they're wrong.

<p> Welp, looks like Gritty's here to stay. Here's hoping he cheers the Flyers onto victory and is unable to enter into our unconscious without our consent.
