<p> ???The only thing I have to say is, ???decaf,'??? said ???

<p> Dancing with the Stars

<p> ??? host

<p> Tom Bergeron

<p> after radio personality

<p> Bobby Bones

<p> ???s opening-night jive during the

<p> season 27 premiere

<p> of the dance competition series. Bones has no formal dance training, but he made the most of his first performance with pro partner

<p> Sharna Burgess

<p> ??? maybe a little too much. Watch his hyperactive performance above, and see what the judges had to say about it below.

<p> Bruno Tonioli

<p> : ???Surreal. It was alike watching

<p> Ryan Seacrest

<p> doing

<p> Buddy Holly

<p> going jiving crazy with red-hot Sharna. It was exquisitely demented. I???m telling you, if you go for it, go that way.???

<p> Carrie Ann Inaba

<p> : ???You???re a little rough around the edges, but something about it was incredible. You???ve got this wild, rock-star thing happening. I don???t know, I loved every minute of it.???

<p> Len Goodman

<p> : ???Well, what you did is you came out and you attacked the dance. You gave it plenty of welly, really went full-on, flat-out. Unfortunately, you sort of got carried away ??? There were a couple of little incidents during the performance.???

<p> The judges were so flabbergasted by the routine that it was a bit challenging to separate their criticisms from their compliments. But they were so transfixed that despite any problems with his technique he got 7s from Inaba and Tonioli and a 6 from Goodman. That gave Bones a total of 20 out of 30, which tied him with

<p> Milo Manheim

<p> for the fifth highest score of the night. Did you think the judges got it right?
