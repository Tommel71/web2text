<p> Method

<p> Heat oven to gas 1, 140°C, fan 120°C. Thinly slice the pears into rounds from the base, picking out any pips. Arrange the slices on a baking tray lined with nonstick baking paper and sprinkle over the mixed spice and use a pastry brush to evenly distribute the spice.

<p> Bake for 40 mins. Leave to cool and crisp – the pears won't feel crisp until cooled. Store in a sealed food bag and eat within a couple of days.
