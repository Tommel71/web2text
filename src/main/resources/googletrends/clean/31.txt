<p> Gianluigi Buffon: Juventus captain 'stands by' Michael Oliver comments

<p> Juventus captain Gianluigi Buffon says he stands by the comments he made about referee Michael Oliver after their dramatic

<p> Champions League quarter-final exit

<p> to Real Madrid.

<p> Buffon was sent off for dissent after Oliver awarded Real an injury-time penalty, and later said the official had

<p> "a bag of rubbish for a heart".

<p> "The content remains and I stand by all of it," the keeper told Italian TV.

<p> "I'd say them all again - maybe with a different type of language."

<p> The 40-year-old Italy international added: "You find a way to speak, right or wrong, that at times can seem excessive - but this is me, I am Gigi Buffon."

<p> Juventus had come back from losing 3-0 at home to lead 3-0 at the Bernabeu in the second leg of the last-eight tie on Wednesday.

<p> Oliver awarded the Spanish side a 93rd-minute penalty for Mehdi Benatia's foul on Lucas Vazquez, which Cristiano Ronaldo scored to send Real through 4-3 on aggregate.

<p> Buffon said on Wednesday that it was a "dubious incident" and, speaking on Saturday, he said he had been defending "my team-mates and fans, even in a not very composed fashion".

<p> "I'm sure Oliver will have a great career in future, but he's too young to officiate a match like that," the goalkeeper added.

<p> "A referee with more experience would not have blown his whistle and decided not to become the protagonist of the match.

<p> "He would have left it running, turned around and let the two teams fight it out in extra time. Let the pitch do the talking."

<p> Police are

<p> investigating threatening text messages

<p> sent to Oliver's wife, Lucy, after she was abused on fans on social media.

<p> 'It's always easy to judge from the outside'

<p> Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri had earlier defended Buffon's reaction, saying for 20 years he had been "a role model on and off the pitch".

<p> "If on one occasion he said the things he did, in a situation as tough as Wednesday night's, that is understandable and I challenge anyone to react differently," Allegri said.

<p> "It's always easy to judge from the outside.

<p> "The referee had a very good game for 90 minutes, he really did. He then slightly lost his way at the end - but these things can happen.

<p> "I don't know if it was correct or not, I don't care. But Buffon was also sent off and therefore denied the opportunity to save the Cristiano Ronaldo penalty. Gigi's reaction is to be understood."

<p> Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane put Buffon's comments down to the keeper being "stressed", adding: "You have to respect his point of view, but I think we deserved to qualify for the semi-finals."
