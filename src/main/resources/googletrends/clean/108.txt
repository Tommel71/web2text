<p> Tony Romo tees off at the 29th annual American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe, Nevada on Sunday

<p> Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo has won a celebrity golf tournament, in which NBA legend Charles Barkley finished dead last.

<p> Romo, who retired after the 2016 NFL season and is now an NFL analyst, rallied from four points back to win the American Century Championship on Sunday in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.

<p> After finishing second in the tournament three times in seven previous starts,

<p> Romo totaled 27 points in the final round to clip former MLB pitcher Mark Mulder - who had won the tournament each of the last three years - and San Jose Sharks captain Joe Pavelski, who led entering Sunday.

<p> 'It's a special win,' said Romo. 'It feels like you're playing a tournament back home here. The day felt good for a lot of reasons.'

<p> The former Cowboys quarterback tapped in for par, worth one point, on the 18th hole to finish with 71 points, three ahead of Mulder, the former major league pitcher. Romo then caught a flight to Berlin, Wisconsin, where he will compete in a 36-hole US Amateur qualifying tournament on Monday.

<p> Romo plays as an amateur, so his $125,000 first-place check from the $600,000 purse in Lake Tahoe will go to local charities and the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, the primary charitable arm of title sponsor American Century Investments.

<p> Barkley, a TNT analyst and 11-time NBA All-Star, finished last with minus-93 points, just behind nine-time NFL Pro Bowler DeMarcus Ware, who had minus-90.

<p> The two players - who tied for a tournament-low minus-30 on Sunday - each finished more than 10 points worse than the rest of the 92-player field.

<p> Gold State Warriors star Stephen Curry tied with two players in 11th place and lost a bet with his father, Dell Curry, which led to the two-time MVP jumping in Lake Tahoe.

<p> Dell Curry jumped in the lake last year but beat his son by two points this year, after negotiating a 20-point handicap.

<p> Mulder totaled 21 points on the day to finish alone in second place with 68 total points.

<p> Pavelski (18) finished at 66 in a tie with 10-time NBA All-Star Ray Allen - who posted the best round of the day with 28 points - for third. Pavelski missed a chance to tie Romo's lead with an eagle putt from seven feet at the par-5 18th, but missed.

<p> 'It feels like nothing went in for me today,' Pavelski said. 'But I couldn't ask for more than to have that putt to tie on the last hole.'

<p> Rounding out the top five were Trent Dilfer, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback with the Baltimore Ravens in 2001, and former tennis player Mardy Fish. Each had 62 points.

<p> Other notable players in the 92-player field included John Smoltz, the MLB hall of Fame pitcher who two weeks ago competed in the U.S. Senior Open and finished 10th here with 53 points; actor Jack Wagner (16th, 47 points); Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (tied for 18th, 44 points); actor Ray Romano (tied for 71st, minus-26 points); comedian Larry the Cable Guy (tied for 77th, minus-33 points).

<p> The tournament uses a modified Stableford scoring system where players earn points for eagles (six points), birdies (three) and pars (one) and lose points (two) for double-bogeys or worse. Bogeys have no effect.
