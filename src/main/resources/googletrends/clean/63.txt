<p> Saturday Night Live

<p> cast member Pete Davidson???s star has risen since his relationship with singer Ariana Grande went from ???

<p> casual

<p> ??? to

<p> 3-carat engagement ring

<p> in a matter of days. Aside from his

<p> SNL

<p> gig and A-list fianc??e though, what do we really know about the 24-year-old?

<p> Well, given reports that he laid out a cool $100k on Grande???s ring, his finances seem to be A-OK. Despite the relatively small salaries of

<p> SNL

<p> cast members, Davidson has a

<p> reported

<p> net worth of $500,000. (Grande's is

<p> $45 million

<p> , by the way.)

<p> Unlike fellow cast mates Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant, Davidson hasn???t done a lot of film and television work outside of the variety show (he had a minor cameo in

<p> Trainwreck

<p> ), but that seems to be changing. Fresh off his fourth season on

<p> SNL

<p> , Pete has two films slated for release this year:

<p> Set It Up

<p> and

<p> Going Places

<p> .

<p> So his career is clearly going places (no pun intended), and his personal life is on the upswing, but,

<p> um

<p> , did he really just spend 20% of his net worth on a ring for his girlfriend of mere weeks? If he keeps up these habits, we could have a Nicolas Cage situation on our hands.
