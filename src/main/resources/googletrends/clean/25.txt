<p> The Fall TV season began in earnest on Monday night, with the arrival of two anticipated freshmen series, including CBS’ reboot of

<p> Magnum P.I.

<p> Are you ready to make Thomas and Friends a part of your

<p> ohana

<p> ?

<p> Jay Hernandez (

<p> Suicide Squad

<p> ) leads this update of the 1980s Tom Selleck series as the titular Thomas Magnum, a private

<p> eye

<p> investigator who welcomes the occasional assist from fellow POW survivors Rick and “TC,” and who lives gratis within the lush Hawaiian estate of (unseen) adventure novelist Robin Masters.

<p> The new series kicks off with Magnum investigating the murder of his team’s fourth member, Sebastian Nuzzo, and it’s a power keg of a case that instantly claims one of Robin Masters’ prized Ferraris.

<p> As Magnum closes in on the suspected killers, he also gets an atypical offer of assistance from Juliet Higgins, the disavowed but highly capable MI:6 agent who serves as the “majordomo” of Masters’ estate (with the help of Dobermans Zeus and Apollo) . Magnum eventually gleans that Nuzzo, a marine salvage expert, had been hired by the killers to track down a cache of stolen Iraqi gold that now lays at the bottom of the ocean six miles off the coast.

<p> The premiere climaxes with Magnum (in a second, ill-fated Ferrari!) speeding after the corrupt Marines on a narrow, winding road, and then skidding in front of their vehicle to take a shot at the driver. As the baddies’ truck is forced off a cliff, Thomas leaps out of the tumbling Ferrari to safety by grabbing onto the skid of a ‘copter being piloted by TC.

<p> Not

<p> appearing in the pilot were recent cast additions Tim Kang (

<p> The Mentalist

<p> ), as HPD Det. Gordon Katsumoto, and Amy Hill (as Robin’s Nest “house mom” Teuila “Kumu” Tuileta).
