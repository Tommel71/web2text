<p> Chevy Chase

<p> has a long history of taking bites of his career with his mouth. He did so again in a

<p> recent interview

<p> in which he had some pointedly unkind words for the show that made him,

<p> Saturday Night Live

<p> .

<p> Specifically, he called the current run of the long-running variety show “the worst fucking humor in the world…” Well, current star and future Mr. Ariana Grande,

<p> Pete Davidson

<p> , wasn’t having any of it.

<p> Appearing on

<p> The Howard Stern Show

<p> (via

<p> PageSix

<p> ) to talk mostly about his fiancé, Davidson held nothing back when addressing Chase and his remarks. “He’s a fuckking douchebag,” the 24-year-old comic said. “Fuckk Chevy Chase… he’s just a genuinely bad, racist person and I don’t like him. He’s a putz.”

<p> He wasn’t done, either:

<p> “What has he done since ’83? Nothing. He had a big career and then it stopped because everybody realized he’s a jerkoff. He should know more than anybody. It’s disrespectful to Lorne [Michaels] too, a guy who gave you a career. No matter how big you get, you can’t forget what that guy did for you.”

<p> Well, in Chase’s defense, he did have

<p> Community

<p> in the late-’00s/early-’10s. But we all know

<p> how

<p> that

<p> ended

<p> .

<p> Saturday Night Live

<p> returns for its 44th season on September 29th. Adam Driver hosts while Kanye West makes his seventh appearance as musical guest.
