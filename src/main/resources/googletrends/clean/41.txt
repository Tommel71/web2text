<p> What Cosby's victim, and her family, told the court

<p> From CNN's Aaron Cooper

<p> Andrea Constand arrives at the sentencing hearing for the sexual assault trial of Bill Cosby

<p> In court today, Andrea Constand and her family read their victim impact statements. (Cosby was

<p> found guilty in April

<p> of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting Constand in 2004.)

<p> Constand spoke for just a few seconds in a clear unemotional voice.

<p> "I have testified, I have given you my victim impact statement. You heard me, the jury heard me and Mr. Cosby heard me. All I'm asking for is justice as the court sees fit," she said.

<p> Gianna Constand, Constand's mother, said she has "lost the ability to trust anybody" and watched friends and loved ones disappear from her life.

<p> "Our lives became one of a roller coaster ride that never came to an end," she said

<p> Andy Constand, her father, also spoke about how the attack affected the whole family.

<p> "The thought of what happened to my daughter Andrea will always be with me forever like a dark cloud hanging over my head," he said.

<p> And Constand's oldest sister, Diana Parsons, called her little sister her hero.

<p> "After everything she has been through, she still walks around with a smile on her face and a positive attitude," she said.

<p> Judge in Cosby case merges counts for sentencing

<p> From CNN's Aaron Cooper

<p> Judge Steven O???Neill announced all three counts have merged for sentencing in the Bill Cosby case because they all stem for the same event.

<p> The sentencing guidelines indicate 22 ??? 36 months, plus or minus 12 months because of the aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

<p> The court has received written victim impact statements from Andrew Constand, her father Andrew Constandt, her mother Gianna Constand and her sister Dianna Parsons. Those written victim impact statements are not public though each took the stand and addressed the court Monday.

<p> The defense did not call any witnesses, but Cosby could take the stand tomorrow.

<p> Court's done for the day

<p> From CNN's Aaron Cooper

<p> Day one of Bill Cosby's sentencing hearing just wrapped up.

<p> Lawyers spent part of the morning arguing over whether it's constitutional to label Cosby a "sexually violent predator" (SVP) and make him register as a sex offender.

<p> A defense witness in the matter was unable to be reached, so the court couldn't continue with the SVP hearing ??? and the actual sentencing can't take place until after the SVP hearing (However, there can be sentencing testimony prior to that).

<p> Court will resume tomorrow.

<p> Court is on break until 1:30 p.m. ET

<p> From CNN's Aaron Cooper

<p> The Pennsylvania courtroom where Bill Cosby is being sentenced is on break until 1:30 p.m. ET.

<p> Proceedings are underway in Montgomery County to sentence the 81-year-old comedian on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. He was

<p> convicted in April

<p> .

<p> Lawyers have been arguing over whether it's constitutional to make Cosby register as a sex offender. Judge Steven T. O'Neill has not yet ruled on whether Cosby will be subjected to the

<p> sex offender designation

<p> .

<p> Kristen Dudley, a psychologist and a

<p> member of the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, testified in state court that Cosby should be labeled a "sexually violent predator" because he has a mental disorder that involves urges toward non-consenting women. Dudley finished her examination just before the break.

<p> Bill Cosby should be labeled a "sexually violent predator" because he has a mental disorder that involves urges toward non-consenting women, a prosecution expert said Monday during the comedian's sentencing hearing on three counts of sexual assault.

<p> "The behaviors are beyond their controls, so they are urged to act on it. He is likely to reoffend," Kristen Dudley, a psychologist and a member of the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, testified in state court.

<p> Judge Steven T. O'Neill has not yet ruled on whether Cosby will be subjected to the

<p> sex offender designation

<p> . Proceedings are underway in Montgomery County to sentence the 81-year-old comedian on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand in 2004. He was

<p> convicted in April

<p> .

<p> A state panel had advised that Cosby should be classified as a "sexually violent predator," which would require him to register with state police and submit to sex offender counseling and community notification for life.

<p> Cosby declined to participate in the evaluation by Dudley, who said she came to her determination by reviewing trial transcripts and other reports.

<p> 17 hr 21 min ago

<p> Legal wrangling continued to the 11th hour

<p> From CNN's Eric Levenson

<p> Monday's sentencing comes as Cosby's defense team, now led by attorney Joseph P. Green Jr., has

<p> accused Judge Steven T. O'Neill of bias

<p> and asked him to remove himself from the case -- and to reverse an order that allowed the trial to happen in the first place.

<p> At issue was a "nasty" personal conflict involving a prior district attorney, Bruce Castor, Cosby's team argued. O'Neil last week denied the motion, calling it untimely and "wholly without merit," court records show.

<p> Camille Cosby, Bill Cosby's wife, said in a statement that she had retained a former prosecutor to facilitate her efforts to "uncover the truth" regarding what she says is a feud between O'Neill and Castor.

<p> Since the April verdicts, Cosby has not been permitted to leave his Pennsylvania home. If he wanted to leave the state for another home, he'd have to arrange it ahead of time and wear a GPS monitoring device, O'Neill ruled in April.
