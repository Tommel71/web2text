<p> About Us

<p> We’re a collective of nationally recognized immigrant-serving organizations, lawyers, technologists, and allies dedicated to helping the undocumented immigrant community.

<p> Everyone in the U.S. is entitled to certain rights under the Constitution, no matter where you were born or who is president. We’re here to help you learn how to put those rights to use so you can feel as prepared as possible if you encounter immigration enforcement. Since November 2016, Informed Immigrant has connected the undocumented immigrant community with the information and resources they need to become empowered in our current political environment. We’re here for you.
