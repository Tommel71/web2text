<p> Described as one of the largest white supremacist events in recent US history, it was organised by Jason Kessler, a former journalist and a member of the Proud Boys, an ultra-nationalist group.

<p> The day before, on Friday, marchers

<p> descended on the University of Virginia carrying torches and yelling slogans "white lives matter" and "blood and soil".

<p> Protesters gathered again on Saturday, and clashed with counter-demonstrators.

<p> At 11:28am (15:35 GMT) a local state of emergency was declared by the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle.

<p> At 1:42pm (17:42 GMT) a speeding car

<p> rammed into anti-racist protesters

<p> , killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others.

<p> The speeding car fled the scene but was soon located and stopped by police.

<p> James Alex Fields Jr

<p> was arrested shortly after the incident and was charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit-and-run.

<p> Is Charlottesville now safe? What is the latest on the ground?

<p> Police intervened after clashes broke out and dispersed the crowd, and Governor McAuliffe

<p> declared

<p> a state of emergency.

<p> The governorâ€™s office also urged all members of the community to stay home on Saturday evening.

<p> What are people saying?

<p> Two days later, after public outcry, he specifically condemned white supremacy.

<p> But on Tuesday, he seemed to backtrack, insisting that there was "blame on both sides" including by anti-fascist protesters.

<p> His comments have drawn widespread criticism from many on all sides of the political spectrum.

<p> The

<p> remarks

<p> were also welcomed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, who tweeted: "Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth."

<p> Senator Bernie Sanders condemned the clashes and said, "it was

<p> a reprehensible display of racism and hatred".

<p> Senator Cory Gardner labelled them as "domestic terrorism":

<p> And former US President Barack Obama wrote:

<p> held

<p> in Charlottesville, giving citizens a chance to offer prayers and support to the victims.

<p> Judge Robert Downer said during a
