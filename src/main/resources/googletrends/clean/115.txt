<p> Turn heads with the infinity display

<p> The Galaxy S8 is like nothing you’ve ever seen before. Its stunning, borderless infinity display not only turns heads, but lets you see more and scroll less. Its glass and metal design makes it look all the more elegant. And it’s rated IP68 for water and dust resistance. So you can take calls in the rain or browse your social media on the beach, without the worry.

<p> Take stunning pictures in low light

<p> With a 12MP main camera and 8MP front-facing camera, you can capture the moment from any angle. And you can say goodbye to blurry selfies on a night out. The Galaxy S8 features low-light image processing, so you’ll be able to take quality snaps in any light. The main camera even autofocusses on faces, so you can re-live the moments that made you smile.

<p> Get the information you need, with Bixby

<p> With your own personal assistant and info services through Bixby Vision, the Galaxy S8's one-stop dashboard makes it easy to do what you want, when you want. At launch, Bixby will be available on all Samsung Galaxy S8 phones, and its voice function is coming soon to the UK.

<p> Unlock the screen just by looking at it

<p> Iris scanning technology means that you can unlock your screen just by looking at it. And because it only unlocks when it recognises your iris, it’s up to 200 times more secure than fingerprint technology. So you can be sure that all the data on your phone will be for your eyes only.

<p> Hear your music how it should be heard

<p> The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus come with AKG earphones. They fit your ears perfectly, and feature the most balanced and authentic sound available in earphones. So wherever you take your phone, you'll be able to listen to your favourite bands as if you were in the front row.
