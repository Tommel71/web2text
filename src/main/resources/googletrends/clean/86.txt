<p> A US cop who gunned down her black neighbour inside his own flat after "mistaking it for her home" has been fired by her bosses.

<p> Dallas Police Department announced Amber Guyger's sacking on Monday saying she had "engaged in adverse conduct" following her arrest for manslaughter.

<p> Botham Shem Jean died on 6 September, after Guyger entered his home in the building where they both lived.

<p> The police officer entered the apartment after finding the door ajar, and saw Mr Jean, 26, in the darkness as a "large silhouette", according to the arrest warrant affidavit.

<p> She said she gave verbal commands that he ignored, so she opened fire while still wearing her police uniform.

<p> The 30-year-old is currently out on ??230,000 bail, pending a criminal trial.

<p> Dallas Police Chief U Renee Hall terminated her employment during a hearing on Monday although she has the right to appeal.

<p> Court records show Ms Guyger had just finished a 15-hour shift when she parked in the wrong garage before making what was apparently a tragic error.

<p> She was booked into the Kaufman County Jail in Dallas, Texas,

<p> following the fatal shooting before

<p> being released on bail.

<p> The 30-year-old - the sole female on an elite crime response team of 10 officers who make high-risk arrests - faces up to 20 years in prison if she is convicted of the manslaughter.

<p> According to police, she told police dispatchers she had mistaken the accountant's apartment at South Side Flats for hers and believed he was an intruder.

<p> The shooting victim's mother, Allison, has since suggested that her son might still be alive if he were white.

<p> "I didn't know she was white until now. If it was a white man would it have been different? Would she have reacted differently?" she told KXAS.

<p> Allison, who has held government posts in St. Lucia, where she lives and where her son grew up, said her son's death "just feels like a nightmare."

<p> Jean's family have hired attorney Benjamin Crump, who is best known for representing the families of shooting victims

<p> Trayvon Martin

<p> and Michael Brown.

<p> Guyger, who has been with the force for four years, reportedly moved into the building in the last two months.

<p> A neighbour captured the moments after the shooting, with footage showing a female officer in uniform tearfully pacing up and down a hallway in the block.

<p> She can be heard screaming: "Oh God!" into her phone before disappearing from view.

<p> Dallas police on Saturday revealed Guyger had worked for Dallas Police Department for four years on the Southeast Patrol Division.

<p> "She is devastated," a Dallas police officer close to Guyger told

<p> Dallas News after the shooting

<p> .

<p> "She is so, so sorry for this family."
