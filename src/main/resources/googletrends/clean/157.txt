<p> or Americans who find the Big Mac is just too small,

<p> McDonald

<p> 's have come up with an answer: the Grand Mac.

<p> The new burger, which is being trialled in Ohio and Texas, still has two patties but they are larger in size - a third of a pound of beef, plus two pieces of cheese and a larger bun.

<p> The company is also testing out a Mac Jr - a single storey version of the original Big Mac.

<p> The sandwich was developed by a franchisee in 1967 and adopted across the whole chain the following year, ultimately evolving into its signature burger.

<p> McDonald's has been

<p> fighting to turn around its business

<p> after seeing customer visits decline in recent years. The Illinois-based company has said it needs to move faster to keep up with changing tastes.

<p> Last week, the company held its biannual convention with franchisees in Florida to discuss plans to refresh the business.

<p> McDonald's announced last year that its breakfast menu would be available all day. And Missouri is trialling

<p> "all you can eat" fries

<p> .

<p> Perhaps surprisingly, the US is not the first country to have its burgers super-sized.
