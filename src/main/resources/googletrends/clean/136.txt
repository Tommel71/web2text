<p> Floyd Mayweather has claimed he will come out of retirement to face Manny Pacquiao in a rematch in December.

<p> The pair first faced off in 2015 as the unbeaten Mayweather came out on top with Pacquiao chasing a rematch ever since.

<p> Mayweather retired following his victory over

<p> Conor McGregor

<p> a year ago but he appears to have been tempted to return.

<p> He posted a video on his

<p> Instagram

<p> of the pair coming face-fo-face in the VIP area of ULTRA Japan, with Mayweather heard shouting: "I'm coming back in December".

<p> And the American added the caption: "I’m coming back to fight Manny Pacquiao this year another 9 figure pay day on the way."

<p> In the clip, Pacquiao is seen gesturing to the American and saying he holds the belt, to which Mayweather replies: "I will take them from you like I did last time."

<p> The pound-for-pound champion then mocks Pacquiao by asking him about his shoulder, which the Filipino suggested was responsible for his 2015 defeat.

<p> Asked recently about a potential rematch, the Pacman said: "If he decides to go back to boxing then that is the time we are going to call the shots.

<p> "I have the belt, so it's up to him. If he wants to come back in boxing, let's do a second one."

<p> The first fight was believed to be the most lucrative of all time, worth over £230m to the two fighters.

<p> Amir Khan has recently set his sights on fighting Pacquiao although a rematch with Mayweather would be much more attractive.
