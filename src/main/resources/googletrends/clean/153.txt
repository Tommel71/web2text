<p> Said, "Lil Bi***, you can't mess with me if you wanted to"

<p> These expensive, there is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes

<p> Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose

<p> And I'm quick, cut a brotha off, so don't get comfortable, look

<p> I don't dance now, I make money move

<p> Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move

<p> If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't mess with you

<p> I'm a boss, your a worker, bi***, I make money move

<p> [Verse 1]

<p> He say he gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see

<p> Little Z, you know where I'm at, you know where I be

<p> You in the club just to party, I get paid a fee

<p> I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me

<p> Honestly, don't give a f*** 'bout who ain't fond of me

<p> Dropped two mixtapes in six months, what bi*** working as hard as me?

<p> I don't bother with these skank, don't let these skank bother me

<p> They see pictures, they say, "Goals," I'm who they tryna be, Look!

<p> [Chorus]

<p> I don't dance now, I make money move

<p> Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move

<p> If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't mess with you

<p> I'm a boss, your a worker, bi***, I make money move
