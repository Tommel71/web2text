<p> Fall TV will soon be back

<p> in the full

<p> swing

<p> of things, and with that comes the 27th season of

<p> Dancing With the Stars

<p> . Longtime fans of the show will be delighted to hear that a lot of the

<p> DWTS

<p> favorites are for sure returning to the dance floor. That being said, there are definitely a few surprises in store for this upcoming competition.

<p> Here's the complete lowdown:

<p> Dancing With the Stars

<p> season 27 will premiere Monday, September 24 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.

<p> All the twirling, gyrating, and foxtrotting will be back before you know it. The first part of the premiere will be a 2-hour installment on Monday, followed by the results show (also 2 hours in length) on Tuesday, September 25 at the same time. Just a heads up that

<p> season 12 of

<p> The Big Bang Theory

<p> is also premiering on CBS on Monday at 8 p.m. (because, well, life)

<p> .

<p> Season 2 of

<p> Young Sheldon

<p> also kicks off at 8:30 p.m. on the 24th. Translation: Prep the DVR and/or get that thumb ready for an evening of rapid channel flipping.

<p> The

<p> Dancing With the Stars

<p> cast is full of TV favorites.

<p> Fans of the show are going to be

<p> especially

<p> pumped this year. This year's lineup includes

<p> Bachelorette

<p> contestant

<p> Joe Amabile

<p> (a.k.a. Grocery Joe),

<p> Fuller House

<p> 's

<p> Juan Pablo Di Pace

<p> , model

<p> Alexis Ren

<p> , Olympic skier

<p> Danelle Umstead

<p> , and radio personality

<p> Bobby Bones

<p> .

<p> As revealed on

<p> Good Morning America

<p> , here's the full cast list:

<p> John Schneider and Emma Slater

<p> DeMarcus Ware and Lindsay Arnold

<p> Milo Manheim and Witney Carson

<p> Mary Lou Retton and Sasha Farber

<p> Nikki Glaser and Gleb Savchenko

<p> Joe Amabile and Jenna Johnson

<p> Danelle Umstead and Artem Chigvintsev

<p> Evanna Lynch and Keo Motsepe

<p> Bobby Bones and Sharna Burgess

<p> Alexis Ren and Alan Bersten

<p> Juan Pablo Di Pace and Cheryl Burke

<p> Tinashe and Brandon Armstrong (new pro alert!)

<p> Nancy McKeon and Val Chmerkovskiy

<p> Notable pros include the

<p> newly engaged Val Chmerkovskiy and Jenna Johnson

<p> (

<p> as of June

<p> ), who will go head-to-head for the Mirror Ball trophy. Competing alongside them will be two-time

<p> Dancing With the Stars

<p> champion Cheryl Burke and three-time runner up Sharna Burgess.

<p> Len Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli are coming back as judges.

<p> As confirmed by

<p> ABC

<p> , all three judges are returning to the table for the upcoming season. Earlier this spring,

<p> a bit of chatter

<p> went around that Len Goodman might be bowing out after being a part of the

<p> DWTS

<p> family for 13 years. Yet, no announcements about his departure have been made.

<p> In terms of guest judges, it seems the list is still up in the air. But if past seasons have proven anything, it's that there will definitely be a surprise judge on the panel here and there.

<p> Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews will return as hosts.

<p> This will mark the seventh season

<p> that Tom and Erin have teamed up to emcee the longtime hit program. While Erin joined the

<p> DWTS

<p> crew in season 18, Tom has held the show's primary hosting gig since its start in 2005. During his years on the show, he has hosted alongside Lisa Canning, Samantha Harris, and Brooke Burke-Charvet.

<p> Dancing With the Stars Juniors

<p> will also be airing this fall.

<p> That means

<p> double

<p> the grooves. To clarify,

<p> DWTS

<p> season 27 is different from a spinoff airing this fall featuring celebrity kids called

<p> Dancing With the Stars Juniors

<p> . The

<p> j

<p> u

<p> nior version is set to premiere on ABC Sunday, October 7 at 8 p.m.
