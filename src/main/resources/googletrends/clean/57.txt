<p> 'The Good Doctor' Renewed for Season 2 at ABC

<p> The Freddie Highmore medical drama from Sony Pictures Television Studios scores an early second-season pickup from the Disney-owned network.

<p> ABC has prescribed another season of

<p> The Good Doctor.

<p> The Disney-owned network has handed out an early season two renewal for the Freddie Highmore medical drama from Sony Pictures Television Studios. An episode count has not yet been determined.

<p> "

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> 's message of inclusiveness resonates with our viewers and is a hallmark of what we aim to accomplish here at ABC," ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said Wednesday in the renewal announcement. "This series has quickly joined the zeitgeist and broken records in the competitive television landscape. We are thrilled to announce that Dr. Shaun Murphy will be back for another season."

<p> The drama from David Shore (

<p> House

<p> ), in which star Highmore plays a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, has become a breakout hit for ABC. The show, which earned Highmore a Golden Globe nomination, has become ABC's most watched first-year show in 13 years and is delivering triple-digit year-over-year time period increases in the network's formerly troubled Monday 10 p.m. slot. It is up 172 percent among total viewers and 162 percent among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic.

<p> The series, which counts Daniel Dae Kim among its executive producers, is based on a Korean format, with a November episode outpacing NBC hit

<p> This Is Us

<p> and CBS'

<p> The Big Bang Theory

<p> when factoring in DVR returns. Fun fact: The series was originally developed for CBS and CBS Television Studios via Kim's former deal with the studio. It was Kim who earned the studio's permission to shop the series elsewhere, with Sony TV-based Shore coming in later.

<p> Early renewals are not common at ABC, so Wednesday's

<p> Good Doctor

<p> pickup should be considered a show of support and a victory lap for producers Sony TV. The series will become increasingly valuable for ABC, which lost prolific producer Shonda Rhimes to Netflix and is poised to say farewell to

<p> Scandal

<p> this season.

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> is the first drama renewed at ABC for the 2018-19 television season. It joins comedies

<p> The Goldbergs

<p> and

<p> Modern Family

<p> . The network also previously ordered two straight-to-series dramas for next season ??? Nathan Fillion starrer

<p> The Rookie

<p> and

<p> Take Two

<p> .
