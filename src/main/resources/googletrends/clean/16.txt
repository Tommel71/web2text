<p> Fox

<p> has given a second-season pickup to medical drama series

<p> The Resident

<p> . This marks the fourth freshman Fox drama to get a Season 2 renewal, joining

<p> 9-1-1, The Gifted

<p> and

<p> The Orville

<p> , making it one of the largest groups of first-year dramas to make it to Year 2 at the network. Like the other three,

<p> The Resident

<p> hails from Fox’s (still-sibling) 20th Century Fox TV.

<p> The Resident

<p> , which had an NFL-boosted launch on Sundays, has been an OK performer in its Monday 9 PM slot behind

<p> Lucifer,

<p> improving the time period by 31% in Adults 18-49 vs. last season. It is Fox’s third-most-watched series behind

<p> 9-1-1

<p> and

<p> Empire

<p> with an average of 7.5 million viewers (most current).

<p> The Resident

<p> also is tied with

<p> The Orville, The Simpsons

<p> and

<p> Star,

<p> which benefitted from an

<p> Empire

<p> lead-in, as Fox’s third-highest-rated series in 18-49 behind

<p> 9-1-1

<p> and

<p> Empire

<p> .

<p> The Resident,

<p> which, along with

<p> 9-1-1,

<p> is giving Fox potential procedural franchises, is averaging more than 10 million multi-platform viewers per episode. Its penultimate episode airs tonight.

<p> Written by Amy Holden Jones, Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi and executive produced by Todd Harthan and Antoine Fuqua,

<p> The Resident’s

<p> first season stars Matt Czuchry, Bruce Greenwood, Manish Dayal, Emily VanCamp, Moran Atias, Merrin Dungey, Shaunette Renée Wilson and Melina Kanakaredes. It centers on a tough, brilliant senior resident (Czuchry) who guides an idealistic young doctor (Dayal) through his first day, pulling back the curtain on what really happens, both good and bad, in modern-day medicine.

<p> Jones, Harthan, Fuqua, Phillip Noyce — who directed the pilot — and Rob Corn executive produce alongside Oly Obst and David Boorstein, while Schore and Sethi serve as co-executive producers for 20th Century Fox TV, 3 Arts Entertainment & Fuqua Films.

<p> “Amy, Todd and all the producers on

<p> The Resident

<p> set out to create a medical show that viewers haven’t seen before – to peel back the curtain and reveal the truth of what happens, both good and bad, behind the scenes at hospitals across the country. Clearly, they’ve succeeded,” said Fox’s president of entertainment Michael Thorn. “Matt, Emily, Bruce, Manish, Shaunette and the show’s entire cast have turned in consistently heartfelt performances, and we are so excited to go back to Chastain Memorial for another tremendous season.”
