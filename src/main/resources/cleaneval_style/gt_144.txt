<p> What Is DACA

<p> On June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible for work authorization. Deferred action is a use of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.

<p> Fee Exemption Guidance

<p> Web page.

<p> Note: There are no fee waivers available for employment authorization applications connected to DACA.

<p> If USCIS Grants DACA in Your Case

<p> If USCIS grants DACA and employment authorization in your case, you will receive a written notice of that decision. An Employment Authorization Document will arrive separately in the mail.

<p> If USCIS Does Not Grant DACA in Your Case

<p> If USCIS decides not to grant DACA in your case, you cannot appeal the decision or file a motion to reopen or reconsider. USCIS will not review its discretionary determinations.

<p> We will apply our policy guidance governing the referral of cases to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the issuance of notices to appear. If your case does not involve a criminal offense, fraud, or a threat to national security or public safety, we will not refer your case to ICE for purposes of removal proceedings except where DHS determines there are exceptional circumstances. For more information on notices to appear, visit

<p> www.uscis.gov/NTA

<p> .

<p> Administrative Errors

<p> You may request a review using the Service Request Management Tool process if you met all of the DACA guidelines and you believe USCIS denied your request because of an administrative error.

<p> Examples:

<p> USCIS believes you abandoned your case by not responding to a request for evidence (RFE), and you believe you did respond within the prescribed time; or

<p> USCIS mailed the RFE to the wrong address, even though you had submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, or changed your address online at

<p> www.uscis.gov

<p> before we issued the RFE.

<p> You can find a full list of possible errors in our

<p> Frequently Asked Questions

<p> .

<p> To make a service request, you must call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. A USCIS representative will then forward your request to the proper USCIS office. Your service request will be reviewed for accuracy and USCIS will send you a letter informing you of its decision.

<p> Travel Information

<p> Certain travel outside the United States may affect the continuous residence guideline. Traveling outside the U.S. before Aug. 15, 2012, will not interrupt your continuous residence if the travel was brief, casual, and innocent. If you travel outside the United States after Aug. 15, 2012, and before we decide your request for DACA, you will not be considered for DACA.

<p> The following chart explains whether your travel will affect your continuous residence.

<p> Travel Dates

<p> Type of Travel

<p> Does it Affect Continuous Residence

<p> On or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012

<p> brief

<p> casual

<p> innocent

<p> No

<p> For an extended time

<p> Because of an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal

<p> To participate in criminal activity

<p> Yes

<p> After Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACA

<p> Any

<p> Yes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.

<p> After Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACA

<p> Any

<p> Yes. You cannot travel while your request is under review. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case.

<p> In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.

<p> On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and receiving DACA

<p> Any

<p> It depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you travel without receiving advance parole, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence.

<p> Once USCIS has approved your request for DACA, you may file

<p> Form I-131

<p> , Application for Travel Document, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States. If you travel outside the United States without first receiving advance parole, USCIS will automatically terminate your DACA.

<p> USCIS is currently updating its policy on granting advanced parole for DACA recipients. Please check the

<p> Frequently Asked Questions

<p> for the latest guidance.

<p> National Security and Public Safety Guidelines

<p> You will not be considered for DACA if you have been convicted of:

<p> A felony offense;

<p> A significant misdemeanor offense; or

<p> Three or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct.

<p> Or

<p> You are otherwise deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety.

<p> What is the difference between “significant misdemeanor”, “non-significant misdemeanor”, and “felony”?

<p> Felony

<p> Significant Misdemeanor

<p> Non-significant Misdemeanor

<p> A felony is a federal, state or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.

<p> A significant misdemeanor is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, one for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is one year or less but greater than five days) and:

<p> Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; or,

<p> If not an offense listed above, is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and therefore does not include a suspended sentence.

<p> A crime is considered a non-significant misdemeanor (maximum term of imprisonment is one year or less but greater than five days) if it:

<p> Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or, driving under the influence; and

<p> Is one for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less.

<p> A minor traffic offense will not be considered a misdemeanor for purposes of DACA, However, driving under the influence is a significant misdemeanor regardless of the sentence. You can find detailed information in the

<p> National Security and Public Safety section

<p> Previous DACA Updates

<p> Sept. 13, 2016

<p> Update:

<p> We are aware that some DACA requestors may have experienced delays receiving their Application Support Center biometrics appointment notices. We recently mailed biometrics appointment notices to those whose notices were delayed. Most of these appointments will be scheduled during the week of October 24, 2016, and we encourage you to appear at your appointment as scheduled. If you need to reschedule an appointment, please follow the instructions on your appointment notice. We will only reschedule a biometrics appointment if you have a compelling reason For more information, please refer to our guidance on rescheduling appointments due to reasons such as illness.

<p> September 12, 2016 Update:

<p> Due to a federal court order, USCIS will not begin accepting requests for the expansion of DACA on February 18 as originally planned. The court's temporary injunction, issued February 16, does not affect the existing DACA. Individuals may continue to come forward and request an initial grant of DACA or renewal of DACA under the guidelines established in 2012 and discussed below.

<p> August 10, 2016 Update:

<p> If you submitted a request for DACA renewal between February 14 and May 14, 2016, your renewal request may have taken longer than expected. You should receive a decision on your case within the next few weeks. USCIS is dedicated to restoring normal processing times as quickly as possible.

<p> June 27, 2016, Update:

<p> The Supreme Court’s 4-4 decision on June 23, 2016, in United States v. Texas does not affect existing policy regarding 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Individuals who meet the 2012 DACA guidelines may continue to come forward and file an initial or renewal request for DACA under the 2012 guidelines.

<p> The Supreme Court decision does, however, mean that the injunction prohibiting implementation of Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and expanded DACA remains in effect
