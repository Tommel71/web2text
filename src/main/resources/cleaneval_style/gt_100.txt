<p> Cardi B and her rapper nemesis

<p> Nicki Minaj

<p> got into a huge fight at a New York Fashion Week event on Friday night.

<p> The pair, both dressed in glamorous gowns, joined a long list of stars at the Harper's Bazaar Icons bash, where the shocking incident took place.

<p> One video shared on social media shows the Bodak Yellow rapper screaming and lunging before she has to be held back by her huge security guard.

<p> According to TMZ, Cardi had approached Nickiâ€™s table to â€œaddress the lies she was spreadingâ€�.

<p> Sources connected to Cardi told the website they believe her security had a plan if she came anywhere near Nicki, and one of them elbowed her in the face.

<p> A second video shoes Cardi, 25, taking off one of her red shoes before hurling it at Nicki.

<p> Pictures taken after the bust-up show the new mum with a huge golfball-sized bump just above her eye and a rip at the back of her floor length red gown.

<p> With both shoes off, Cardi was then escorted out of the building by security.

<p> A few hours after the drama went down, Cardi took to social media to slam Nicki in a lengthy attack.

<p> "I've let a lot of s**t slide! I let you sneak diss me, I let you lie on me, I let you attempt to stop my bags, f**k up the way I eat," she fumed.

<p> â€œYouâ€™ve threatened other artists in the industry, told them if they work with me youâ€™ll stop f**kin with them!! I let you talk big s**t about me!!!"

<p> Cardi then accused Nicki of questioning her abilities as a parent.

<p> "I addressed you once in person, I addressed you a second time in person, and every time you copped the plea! But when you mention my child, you choose to like comments about me as a mother, make comments about me as a mother, make comments about my abilities to take care of my daughter is when all bets are f**kin off!"

<p> She added: "I've worked too hard and come too far to let anybody f**k me with my success!!! B**tches talk all that s**t in they raps but in real like they p***y! This s**t really is for entertainment!"

<p> Meanwhile, Nicki shared a clip shortly after the altercation showing that she hadn't suffered any injuries.

<p> "The infamous *I ain't got no damages* video," one of her fans commented.

<p> She followed it up with two more posts from inside the event.

<p> Rumours of a feud began to swirl when the fellow rappers seemingly started takings shots at each other in their tracks shortly after Cardi's fame skyrocketed early last year.

<p> Then, in August 2017, Cardi slammed a mystery woman during a performance, which fans assumed was Nicki.

<p> "You know this b***h," Cardi said. "She never f**king liked me and now, all of a sudden, she wants to be friends with me. No, b***h. I still don't like you b***h."

<p> More recently, Nicki found herself denying that her new songs were directed at Cardi.
