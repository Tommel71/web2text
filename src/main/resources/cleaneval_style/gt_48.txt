<p> You know Kylie Jenner was going all out to celebrate her best friend Jordyn Woods' 21st birthday, especially after Jenner's own

<p> 21st birthday blowout this summer

<p> .

<p> The besties kicked things off this past Thursday with a dinner in West Hollywood, wearing eye-popping mini dresses. Jordyn looked incredible in a sparkling orange number, while Kylie debuted pink hair in a

<p> $795 Alejandro Collection design

<p> .

<p> It's a whole birthday weekend for Jordyn, who is also celebrating her new collection with Kylie Cosmetics, launching yesterday. Woods and Jenner threw a party with a ton of pink heart-shaped balloons, a gigantic dessert table featuring gold cake pops with their faces on it, and a family and friend filled luncheon. There was even an adorable appearance from baby Stormi.

<p> Jordyn and Kylie would later party at a bowling alley, with Woods wearing a glitzy bowling outfit as she cut a huge sparkly cake. Guests were also given personalized throwback t-shirts. Kylie's design hilariously reads, 'Baby Mama.'
