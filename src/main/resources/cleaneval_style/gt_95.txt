<p> Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau sat down for an exclusive interview on

<p> Australia???s

<p> Sunday

<p> Night

<p> ,

<p> where they were joined by their children Audrey and Georgia for the first time on camera.

<p> The daughters, 19 and 21, respectively, of the notorious couple spoke out about their childhood in a family situation that was incomprehensible to many. Audrey was born while their mother was on trial, whereas Georgia was born in prison while their mother served time for the second-degree rape of their father. Letourneau was 34 and Fualaau???s sixth-grade teacher at Shorewood Elementary school in Burien, Wash., when their relationship began. Fualaau was 12 at the time.

<p> The two girls were raised by teenage Fualaau and his mother while Letourneau served a seven-year prison sentence. Their upbringing was different and under intense media scrutiny, but Audrey said that it was their normal.

<p> ???It doesn???t feel any different just because it???s not really brought to our attention,??? Audrey said of their unusual family dynamic. ???Or just because we grew up with it, so we???re adapted to it.???

<p> But the two women aren???t the only ones who grew up under these unique circumstances. Fualaau also grew up after becoming a father at age 13 ??? taking some time to date other people while Letourneau was in jail and even questioning the state of their 2005 marriage with a short-lived separation filing in 2017.

<p> ???I can???t regret, after my two daughters and the entire life that I???ve already lived, I???ve learned that regretful is actually a bad thing,??? the now 35-year-old father said in the interview. ???It???s my journey through life, so I gotta live it out.???

<p> Fualaau also stated that he couldn???t see himself doing what his wife had done all those years ago, now that he is nearly the same age that she was when their affair began. And although the difficulty of the situation has left him feeling like giving up sometimes, Fualaau explains how he was determined to keep his family together for the sake of his girls.

<p> ???I wanted both my kids to have both parents in the same roof, something I never had,??? he said. ???So I did it for them.???

<p> Now that Audrey and Georgia are adults, they recall Letourneau being the strict parent and admit that Fualaau is a young dad, even calling him ???a friend dad.??? Fualaau is less than two decades older than his daughters.

<p> Letourneau has a strained relationship with the four children she had with her ex-husband Steve, who she was married to at the time of her affair with Fualaau. As for the state of Letourneau and Fualaau???s relationship today, they???re still trying to make their marriage work as they become empty nesters.

<p> ???Mary does her best every single day, and that???s how the story ends,??? Letourneau said about herself, while Fualaau simply said, ???I???ll go with that.???
