<p> What is a solar eclipse?

<p> A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's orbit lines up in between the Sun and the Earth.

<p> The Moon blocks out the Sun's light for a short time, casting a shadow on the Earth.

<p> It's a rare event and only possible when the Moon is at exactly the right distance from the Earth.

<p> What causes a Solar eclipse?

<p> When can I see an eclipse in the UK?

<p> On Friday 20 March the UK will experience the first eclipse of 2015.

<p> It will be a partial eclipse, so the sky will darken but the Sun will still peek out from behind the Moon.

<p> People living in the north of the UK will see more of the Sun covered

<p> 8.45am

<p> - the eclipse will begin in the UK

<p> 9.31am

<p> - the Moon will be nearest the middle of the Sun

<p> 10.41am

<p> - daylight is restored and the eclipse is over

<p> Selfie warning!

<p> "In 1999, when there was the last major eclipse, no-one really had smartphones or took selfies," said Daniel Hardiman-McCartney, an eye expert from the College of Optometrists.

<p> "This could potentially be very dangerous because people might be tempted to look at the Sun as they try to get the perfect shot or clip."

<p> Selfie warning for solar eclipse

<p> Safety first...

<p> Never look directly at the Sun: you can damage your eyes forever.

<p> Even the small amount of Sun peeking out from behind the Moon during an eclipse is enough to make you go blind.

<p> Never look at the Sun through binoculars or a telescope.

<p> Don't look directly at the Sun through sunglasses, or exposed photographic film - they will not protect your eyes.

<p> How can I safely watch the eclipse?

<p> PA

<p> Special eclipse viewing specs provide a safe way to watch the eclipse...

<p> PA

<p> ...but the safest option is to watch the eclipse broadcast on live TV.

<p> How to make a pinhole camera

<p> Another way to safely enjoy the eclipse is to make a pinhole camera. This will project an image of the eclipse onto card.

<p> You'll need two pieces of card. Make a small hole in the centre one of them - no more than 4mm across.

<p> Tilt the card with the hole towards the Sun and use it to project an image of the eclipse onto the other card.

<p> Royal Astronomical Society

<p> Pinhole cameras should only be used with your back to the Sun

<p> When is the next eclipse in the UK?

<p> The next big partial eclipse in the UK will be in August 2026.

<p> The UK hasn't seen a total solar eclipse - where the Moon completely covers the Sun - since 1999, and won't get another one until 2090.
