<p> Former NFL player

<p> Aaron Hernandez

<p> broke down sobbing while admitting he was gay, his former lawyer has said.

<p> Jose Baez detailed the final days of his client in a new book,

<p> Unnecessary Roughness

<p> .

<p> The attorney has written that he told Hernandez that prosecutors were planning to question his fiancee during his double murder trial.

<p> He said that prosecutors intended to discuss Hernandez’ extramarital affairs, supposedly with one woman and one man, during her questioning.

<p> Baez said this caused the former athlete to break down sobbing as it would out him as gay in front of his fiancee, the Daily Mail reports.

<p> ‘But Jose, she’ll be devastated. I never meant to hurt her. I know I keep disappointing her. But she is my soul,’ Baez said Hernandez told him.

<p> ‘She is all I have and will ever have.’

<p> ‘Hernandez was clearly gay’

<p> Rumors have circulated for years over whether Hernandez was gay or bisexual.

<p> George Leontire, another former attorney of Hernandez, said the sports star was ‘clearly gay’, The Boston Globe reported.

<p> ‘[I] acknowledged the immense pain that it caused him. I think that he also came out of a culture that was so negative about gay people that he exhibited some self-hatred,’ Leontire said.

<p> Leontire also said that Hernandez was concerned about how his supposed homosexuality would affect his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez.

<p> In a 2017 interview with TV personality Dr. Phil, Jenkins-Hernandez said she felt there was

<p> no indication he was gay

<p> . ‘I had no indication or any feeling that he was [gay],’ she said. ‘He was very much a man to me. I don’t know where this came from.’

<p> Hernandez played as a tight end with the New England Patriots for three seasons from 2010 to 2012.

<p> His football career came to an abrupt end in 2013 when he was charged with the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. He was later found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder.

<p> The week before he died, Hernandez had been found not guilty of the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.

<p> Hernandez was publically outed on The Kirk & Callahan Show radio show. He committed suicide in his cell two days later. He was 27 years old.
