<p> Kylie Jenner

<p> and

<p> Jordyn Woods

<p> are living their best friendship-goals life. They made it official with their latest capsule-collection launch: In celebration of their business partnership, with the release of Kylie ❤ Jordyn, the duo threw a pink-themed party, wearing matching latex minidresses, with all of Jordyn and Kylie’s families in attendance.

<p> Kylie opted for bubblegum pink, which is a tone she’s been loving lately. She even recently dyed her hair the same bright Barbie-approved tone to match her head-to-toe look. Jordyn went for more of a mocha hue, but reached for the very same shiny tank dress as her bestie, Kylie. Both girls’ dresses are from Laroxx and, though you can’t shop their exact custom looks, you can check out the company’s PVC basics

<p> That said, if you’re dying to get the look, you can always harken (not so far) back to a few weeks ago, when Kylie was

<p> seen out in Hollywood

<p> wearing a dusty-rose-colored Latex tank dress from Vex that is still available

<p> on the brand’s website

<p> , and in nearly every color of the rainbow.

<p> Though the concept of twinning with your BFF isn't anything new, Kylie and Jordyn found a way to make it look better than ever.
