<p> Do you like this video?

<p> In the next film I wouldn't mind seeing Jessica Cruz and Simon Baz as the Green Lanterns on the team, instead of Hal or John. I would be a nice new interpretation that explores those characters, includes the teams GL, doesnt have the Hal Jordan backlash that so many complain about, and lets theses characters be in Justice League while we have a seperate Hal and John buddy cop GL film. Let's face it, this makes sense.

<p> wow i hope this doesn't flop. and i honestly can't wait to see how all of it goes.

<p> I hope the world in the DCEU is at peace after all the heroes saved it from evil and have a good happy ending, like in the end of Watchmen, with the newspaper editor and his employer.

<p> In the Flying Fox of the Justice League, there are assembled the world's four greatest heroes created from the cosmic legends of the universe!

<p> Superman! Wonder Woman! Batman! Aquaman! The Flash! And the Cyborg!

<p> Their mission: To fight injustice, to right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind!

<p> You said four but listed six ...

<p> My mistake. It won't happen again.

<p> By the way, this quote I just wrote is from Super Friends, the 1973 Hanna-Barbera/DC Comics cartoon.

<p> Okay so clearly the majority of the Justice League movie will be Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. That will be who we see for the most of it. But we know Superman is in it and will contribute to the final battle at least. But what about Green Lantern? Surely he has to be in the movie so he is at least with the JL when the battle. Right? They've been going on about "Uniting the Seven" so you'd think he's a safe bet. I just really hope he doesn't appear in the last 2 seconds. He shouldn't be a cameo he should fight with the league. DON'T LET ME DOWN!

<p> With the things are going, I'm willing to bet we get the Hall of Justice instead of the Watchtower. At first, I was thinking they'd somehow retrofit and rebuild the Black Zero, since it was basically like a mini-Watchtower, but I don't see that happening without J'onn on the roster... yet.

<p> Technically Justice League is known as the Justice League of America (JLA).

<p> Not this version xD

<p> That was on New Earth - the Justice League or Justice League of America.

<p> But on Earth Prime - The New 52 and DC Rebirth, there were a few Justice League teams.

<p> 1: Justice League.

<p> 2: Justice League Dark.

<p> 3: Justice League International.

<p> 4: Justice League of America.

<p> 5: Justice League of America II.

<p> 6: Justice League United.

<p> That's all I know.

<p> It's Prime Earth actually.

<p> Kara, though confirmed to have existed, is unconfirmed as to being alive.

<p> Barbara, most likely, doesn't have the experience to be considered orfor the league.

<p> December 14, 2017

<p> by

<p> (anonymized)

<p> You're asking like I know, aside from the fact that she has never been a member of the Justice League. Batgirl has never been an official member of the Justice League, just an affiliate of Batman and thus a 'membrr' by proxy.

<p> December 15, 2017

<p> (anonymized)

<p> Well i meant that Supergirl should be a member, but now that you think of it. Batgirl should too. She is just as qualified as Bruce is.

<p> Shouldn't there be allies and enemies on this page as well?

<p> May 19, 2017

<p> by

<p> (anonymized)

<p> Yeah, but we don't really know the allies of the JL as a whole, and the only enemy so far is Parademons, so it's not that big of a requirement for now

<p> Are Superman and Wonder Woman realy immortal? Because immortality

<p> has quit a few Downsides

<p> ?

<p> April 22, 2017

<p> by

<p> (anonymized)

<p> It's more along the lines of Longevity, as superman has been shown in the comics to be capable of living across multiple lifetimes while on Earth. I'm not that well versed on WW to state whether or not she's lived across timelines with or w/o aging

<p> April 24, 2017

<p> by

<p> (anonymized)

<p> Longevity and Immortality, what's the diffrence between the two?

<p> July 14, 2017

<p> by

<p> (anonymized)

<p> Longevity is the ability to live for an extended amount if time. Logan possesses longevity, a his healing factor shows down his cell decay, this taking longer for his cells to die.

<p> Immortality is the ability to live forever. Vandal Savage is immortal, as he cannot be killed and cannot die. I believe the DCEU vessel of Wonder Woman is effectively immortal, since she's a goddess. ( yes, goddess, as she wasnt born through consummation between a god and Amazonian, which wild make her a Demi-god. She's amazonian by nationality only.)

<p> Superman had passed away?

<p> April 2, 2017

<p> Superman had to sacrifice himself by stopping Doomsday. But the end of Batman v Superman reveals that he's alive, so he will join the Justice League later on.
