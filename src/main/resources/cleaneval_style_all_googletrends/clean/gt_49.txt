<p> Season 6 releasing later this week, Epic Games is yet to reveal any teasers.

<p> Despite the lack of Season 6 teasers, Epic has released early version 6.0 patch notes.

<p> The next major Fortnite update drops on September 27, and will include big changes to the game's sound effects. You can see for yourself in the patch notes below...

<p> ??? Glider audio tells

<p> ??? Increased awareness when an enemy is gliding in your vicinity.

<p> ??? Doppler-based glider audio for incoming threats. This will create that ???car passing by??? effect when a player glides over top of you.

<p> ??? Improved spatialization of both skydiving and gliding players.

<p> ??? Ability to hear the open/close sounds of gliders from further away.

<p> Fortnite Season 6 has been delayed on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PC, iOS and Android.

<p> Epic Games recently announced that the Season 6 release date has been delayed until September 27.

<p> This also means that Season 5 has been extended, giving players a few extra days to grab those Battle Pass rewards.
