<p> Today, the AMBER Alert system is being used in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Indian country, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and 22 other countries. As of March 2018, a total of 924 children had been successfully recovered through the AMBER Alert system.

<p> AMBER Alerts will link to photos of missing children under FCC upgrades.

<p> On September 29, 2016, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

<p> approved improvements

<p> to Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a system that delivers critical warnings and information to wireless phone users. The FCC updates are intended to enhance the information state and local authorities are able to send into communities. The changes include requiring wireless providers to support inclusion of embedded phone numbers and URLs in all WEA alerts, including allowing users to link to pictures and phone numbers in AMBER Alert urgent child-abduction bulletins. The new FCC rules are planned to be implemented within the next 30 months.
