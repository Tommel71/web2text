<p> ortnite Season 6

<p> is now live and the Battle Royale phenomenon's players are getting their first taste of a changed map that features a new location in the Wailing Woods to the north-east and a floating island complete with haunted castle above Loot Lake.

<p> In a blog post detailing the patch notes for Fortnite version 6.0, Epic said that fans will be able to explore a changed map with floating islands and new corrupted areas, players will now be able to take pets and there is the new Shadow Stones, a new consumable that allows you to 'become one with the shadows'. However, shadow stones are temporarily disabled due to a bug that allowed players to 'phase' into closed areas and retain access to weaponry. Which wasn't supposed to happen. Epic do not have a estimated time for the fix.

<p> After a short period of downtime, which began at 9am BST,

<p> Fortnite Season 6

<p> is now live and players are exploring the map after Epic revealed a host of information about the new season this earlier this morning.

<p> T

<p> he latest tease yesterday, featured a glowering wolf figure, again reflected in the side of 'Kevin', the mysterious purple cube that has been travelling the Fortnite map for the last few weeks of Season 5. It simply came with the caption 'Tomorrow'. PS4 players were also treated to the news that

<p> Sony has enabled PS4 crossplay

<p> , meaning players can now play with friends on other platforms Xbox One, Switch, PC and mobile.

<p> A masked cowgirl followed on Tuesday. All teasers have been reflected in the side of Kevin, fuelling the fan theory that Fortnite Season 6 will feature an evil mirror universe theme. Epic has confirmed that players will have to contest with the 'corruption of the cube'.

<p> T

<p> he messages have been as cryptic as anything in the lead up to the end of Season 5 and beginning of Season 6, but could offer a glimpse at one of the new skins. August was a record-breaking month for the game of the moment, with 78.3m players logging in to battle 99 other players in an effort to be the last combatant standing.

<p> What is the Fortnite story so far?

<p> Despite Fortnite????????s simplicity in its core mechanics --drop onto an island, find weapons, survive until the end-- Epic have built an intriguing brand of environmental and even real-world narrative of colliding parallel worlds into its game.

<p> Back in July a rocket launched across its map, creating a giant crack in the sky. Rifts then started appearing around Fortnite????????s map, changing locations significantly as the game????????s world and the real world collided. A sign for Durr Burger in Fortnite, sucked out of the game, appeared in the real-world California desert.

<p> M

<p> eanwhile Fortnite????????s map has undergone significant changes, with a comet crashing into Dusty Depot, leaving just a crater with variable gravity. Film sets have appeared as well as various other changes. MOisty mire in the south-east, was replaced by Paradise Palms, a desert biome apparently pulled in from that California location.

<p> Tilted Towers, meanwhile, was destroyed by the purple cube that travelled the map throughout season 5 after dropping out of the rift.

<p> Now the cube, dubbed ???????Kevin???????? has found its final resting place in Loot Lake, turning the contentious water mass in the centre of the map into a jelly trampoline. What will happen in Season 6 will likely be related to Kevin????????s journey.

<p> How has the map changed in Fortnite Season 6?

<p> T

<p> here are new locations in the form of the Wailing Wood to the north-east and corn fields, while corrupted areas have sprung up around the map for a nice visual change.

<p> L

<p> oot Lake has also changed significantly, now with a floating island above its black waters. It was previously a gelatinous purple mass, with runes beneath the surface suggesting that its full transformation is yet to come. That has come to pass with the emergence of the haunted castle on the island above. Loot Lake has been a bone of contention for many players, with its water slowing players down or requiring them to use a lot of resources to build across to cross or reach the house at the centre. How it plays now will be one of the interesting gameplay connotations of the floating island.

<p> What new skins, challenges and items will be on offer in Fortnite Season 6?

<p> The new skins, or costumes, in Fortnite season 6 feature a Halloween party theme. The first two skins that come with the battle pass in tier 1 are DJ Yonder, the Daft punk-esque llama and Calamity, the cowgirl whose outfit upgrades five times to reach the full kit of the teaser image below.

<p> Giddy-Up, a guy riding an inflatable llama, is unlocked at Tier 23. Fable, a Red Riding Hood skin is unlocked at Tier 47. The fabulously vampiric Dusk is at 71. Pumpkin-headed Nightshade is at 86. Werewolf Dire rounds off the set at Tier 100, though you have to earn XP to see him go from regular teenager to full blown hound.

<p> P

<p> ets are now available, who are unlocked as back bling, riding in a backpack and react to the world around them. Pup Bonesy is the first pet unlocked at Tier 12. And if you are looking for a new toy, you can unlock a tomato at Tier 28 to chuck at your rivals.

<p> How much will the Fortnite Season 6 Battle Pass cost?

<p> Epic has confirmed the Battle Pass will cost 950 V-Bucks, or around ????7. The map changes and challenges will be available to all players for free, as ever. Here is what is included:
