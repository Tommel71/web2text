<p> SEASON 6 RELEASE DATE - UPDATE TWO:

<p> The Fortnite season 6 release date and Fortnite season 5 end date has been pushed back.

<p> At first when Fortnite season 5 was launched an in-game countdown said the Battle Pass would end on September 17, with this later changing to September 25.

<p> And now Epic Games has officially confirmed the Fortnite season 6 release date as Thursday September 27, with Wednesday September 26 the last full day to play season 5.

<p> On Twitter the official Fortnite account posted: ???Season 6 is now dropping from the Battle Bus on September 27.

<p> ???Celebrate its arrival and unlock those final Battle Pass rewards with an additional 400% Match XP all weekend, from now until September 24 at 8 AM ET (1200 GMT). Glide into the party!???

<p> FORTNITE SEASON 6 RELEASE DATE - UPDATE ONE:

<p> The Fortnite season 5 end date has changed in the Battle Pass countdown.

<p> The Fortnite Battle Pass has a countdown saying how much time is left until season 5 finishes.

<p> Previously it said that Fortnite season 5 would end on Monday September 17 2018, but now it says it will end on Monday September 24.

<p> This comes as rumours have surfaced that the Fortnite season 5 end date could get delayed even further until Tuesday October 2.

<p> This could mean Fortnite season 6 would have a release date on Wednesday October 3 if it begins the day after the Fortnite season 5 end.

<p> Alternatively, if the Fortnite season 6 release date is delayed by a day or two it could launch on Thursday October 4 or Friday October 5.

<p> ORIGINAL:

<p> Fortnite season 6 release date could have been revealed by Epic Games. Here???s what we know about when season 6 could start and the season 5 end date.

<p> The Fortnite season 5 Battle Pass is out now and is running a countdown showing how much time is left for Battle Royale players to play.

<p> The Fortnite season 5 Battle Pass brings with it over 100 tiers to unlock and over 100 rewards for Battle Royale fans.

<p> At the moment the countdown in Battle Pass says that Fortnite season 5 will have an end date of Monday September 17 2018.

<p> With past season crossovers, the brand new Battle Pass began the day after the final day of the previous Fortnite season.

<p> So that could mean that Fortnite season 6 has a release date of Tuesday September 18 2018.

<p> Fortnite season 4 also launched on a Tuesday so Epic Games do have form in launching new Fortnite seasons on that day.

<p> However, it???s important to bear in mind that Epic Games delayed past Battle Royale season launches.

<p> The end of Fortnite season 4 and the launch of Fortnite season 5 was pushed back by two days.

<p> While the launch of Fortnite season 3 and the end of Fortnite season 2 was also pushed back by Epic Games.

<p> So, if Epic Games decides to delay Fortnite season 6 by two days then it could, alternatively, have a Thursday September 20 release date.

<p> In terms of a start time, Epic Games typically begin server downtime for their new Fortnite seasons at 9am UK time, which is 4am eastern and 1am pacific.

<p> So, whether Fortnite season 6 begins on Tuesday September 18 or Thursday September 20 - it's likely that servers will be going down around those times.

<p> At the moment, what Fortnite season 6 could feature remains a complete mystery.

<p> You can bet there will be plenty of new skins, challenges and maybe even some new map locations in Fortnite season 6.

<p> Fortnite season 5 started with cracks still appearing in the Battle Royale sky, new locations and rifts that transport players hundreds of feet into the air.

<p> It remains to be seen whether these cracks will get bigger and bigger throughout season 5.

<p> And whether the pay off to these cracks will occur during Fortnite season 5.

<p> Alternatively, could it be possible that these cracks continue getting bigger until the start of Fortnite season 6 - and that???s when they break completely open?

<p> Maybe that will be the point when a completely new map for Battle Royale is released, or multiple maps are available for players to choose from.

<p> ??? The Fortnite season 5 Battle Pass can be purchased for 950 V-Bucks right now on PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Mobile, PC and Macs. An Android release is also planned for this summer.
