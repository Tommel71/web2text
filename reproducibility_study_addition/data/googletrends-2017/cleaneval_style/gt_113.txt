<p> Pembroke Welsh Corgi Information

<p> Pembroke Welsh Corgi Description:

<p> The origin of the

<p> Pembroke Welsh Corgi

<p> lies in Pembrokeshire, Wales. The breed is one of the oldest herding breeds known, dating as far back as the 12th century. Although the exact descendant of the breed is unknown, it is believed to have descended from Vallhund, Pomeranian, Keeshond and the Schipperke. In the olden days, it was primarily used for herding cattle. Over the years, the breed has gained popularity as a companion breed, with Queen Elizabeth II owning several Pembroke Welsh Corgis. The breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1934.

<p> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a small sized dog with a long and strong frame. It has a fox like head; medium sized eyes which are oval in shape and dark brown in color; medium sized ears which are carried erect; a black nose; a slightly long muzzle which is square in appearance and gradually tapers towards the end; taut lips which are black in color with teeth which meet in scissors bite or level bite. This breed has a docked tail which is set low. The tail is plumed and carried at or below the level of the back. It has short legs which are strong and straight with oval shaped, well padded feet. It has a double coat with a medium length outercoat which is rough to touch and, a soft and dense weather resistant undercoat. The color of the coat can be red, sable, fawn, black or tan; may have some white markings on the head, chest, neck, legs and underparts of the body.

<p> The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a loyal and obedient breed. It is playful in nature and does well with kids as well as other dogs and pets. However, it is slightly reserved with strangers and has strong protective instincts, which makes it a good guard dog. It has a tendency to bark as well which makes it a good watchdog too. It is an easy to train breed and thus, is well suited to beginners. If given the right amount of exercise, it adapts well to an apartment life.
