<p> With the deadly Hurricane Irma still wreaking havoc in the Caribbean, the US National Hurricane Center announced today that Jose is expected to gain in strength and intensify into a major hurricane by Friday.

<p> The hurricane is currently located about 660 miles east of the Lesser Antilles with maximum sustained winds of 105mph, the Miami-based weather forecaster reported on Thursday.

<p> Swells generated by Jose are likely to affect portions of the Leeward Islands by Saturday, the NHC said, adding hurricane watches were issued for the northern portion of the region, including the islands of Antigua and Barbuda, which have been left in shambles as a result of Irma.

<p> The category 5 storm on Wednesday claimed at least 10 lives and devastated the islands of Saint Martin and Anguilla, before continuing on its course towards the Dominican Repbulic, Bahamas and Turks and Caicos.

<p> Jose is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 6 inches in the Leeward Islands from Dominica to Anguilla.

<p> Isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches are possible in the northern Leeward Islands from Antigua and Barbuda to Anguilla. This rainfall will maintain any ongoing flooding and may cause additional life-threatening flooding.

<p> Swells generated by Jose are likely to affect portions of the Leeward Islands by Saturday.

<p> At the same time, Hurricane Katia wheeled in place off the Mexican Gulf coast on Thursday, but it was expected to gain strength before it approached land by late Friday or early Saturday, the NHC reported.

<p> A Category 1 hurricane, Katia was 210 miles east of the Mexican port city of Tampico, blowing maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, and may be close to major hurricane strength by the time it is expected to make landfall this weekend, the NHC said.

<p> Category 1 is the NHC's weakest hurricane designation. Category 5 is the strongest. Storms of Category 3 and above are defined as major hurricanes.

<p> For the first time in seven years, there are now three hurricanes in the Atlantic.

<p> Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms in a century and a Category 5, spread devastation in Saint Martin, where it killed eight people, and destroyed 90 per cent of structures on Barbuda, where a two-year-old child perished in the storm, as it took aim at Florida.

<p> Katia was expected to begin moving again and turn southward, and it is forecast to hit the state of Veracruz by early Saturday.

<p> Katia has 'worrying characteristics' because it is very slow moving and could dump a lot of rain on areas that have been saturated in recent weeks, Luis Felipe Puente, head of Mexico's national emergency services, told domestic television on Wednesday.
