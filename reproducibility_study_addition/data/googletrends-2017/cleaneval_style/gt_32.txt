<p> 10 November 2017

<p> John Hillerman, the US actor who shot to fame as snooty English caretaker Higgins in Tom Selleck's '80s TV series Magnum PI, has died at the age of 84.

<p> Hillerman's publicist said he died of natural causes on Thursday at his home in Houston, Texas.

<p> Born in 1932, Hillerman started out on stage before landing small roles in such '70s classics as The Last Picture Show, Blazing Saddles and Chinatown.

<p> But he is best known for Magnum, which won him a Golden Globe and an Emmy.

<p> Hillerman beat several British actors to the Higgins role, which he once called "the best gig I've ever had".

<p> He proved so convincing that he once received a fan letter from the UK describing him as "a credit to the Empire".

<p> "I hate to disappoint you, but I'm a hick from Texas," he would write back to fans who assumed he was British.

<p> The actor was last seen on screen playing a doctor in 1996 comedy A Very Brady Sequel.

<p> Larry Manetti, who played bar owner Orville "Rick" Wright in Magnum, remembered Hillerman on Twitter as a "good friend".

<p> Others tweeted tributes using pictures of 'Higgins' with his loyal Doberman Pinschers, Zeus and Apollo.
