<p> What'd Youppi! look like after a bender? The new Flyers mascot, probably

<p> Is this a mascot, a horror film character, or a cautionary tale?

<p> Yikes!

<p> The Philadelphia Flyers have a new mascot, and it looks an awful lot like something out of an after-school special designed to scare Youppi! into sobriety. It also looks plain awful.

<p> Given the horrifically on-the-nose name “Gritty,” the orange creation appears to view Tom Hanks’ grooming choices in Castaway as aspirational.

<p> Granted, the Habs have not given Youppi! cause to grow a playoff beard of late, but we’re pretty sure he’d do better than whatever happened to Gritty.

<p> If the Flyers wanted to go down this road, they should have just hired Animal from The Muppets.

<p> Anyhow, if you’d like to scare children this Halloween, that’s your costume idea sorted out.
