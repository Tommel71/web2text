<p> Coffee & Company

<p> Introducing Starbucks First New Beverage of 2017, the Cascara Latte

<p> When you think of coffee, its roasted form is usually the first image that springs to mind. But coffee begins its life inside a coffee cherry, two pale light green beans surrounded by a round, ripe, red fruit.

<p> This winter, Starbucks is introducing the

<p> Cascara Latte

<p> with flavors from the fruit of the coffee cherry. Inspired by the

<p> Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Seattle,

<p> Starbucks first new beverage of 2017 will be available in stores in the U.S. starting January 10 and through the winter while supplies last. Starbucks Rewards™ members can get a first taste of the beverage beginning Friday, January 6. Starbucks customers will also be able to order returning favorite the

<p> Starbucks® Smoked Butterscotch Latte

<p> , also inspired by the Roastery, beginning Friday, January 6.

<p> “Cascara is Spanish for ‘husk,’ and we are taking the fruit of the coffee cherry to give our latte a subtle, lightly sweet flavor,” said Erin Marinan from Starbucks Beverage Research and Development team.

<p> Starbucks® Cascara Latte combines espresso with steamed milk and cascara syrup, topped with velvety foam. A sprinkle of cascara topping, made with cascara extract and cane sugar, finishes the beverage in a signature straight line, which mirrors the inside of a coffee cherry.

<p> “Cascara Latte has a nice dark brown sugar and maple flavor that is subtly sweet,” Marinan said. “As you look at the beverage from the top, it looks like a coffee bean,” she said. “It’s full circle.”

<p> Baristas from the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Seattle first paired cascara with coffee at its Barista Innovation Challenge in September, and featured the winning cascara beverage on its menu in the fall.

<p> Anatomy of a Coffee Cherry

<p> Once every year, coffee trees yield coffee cherries. The process begins with the bloom of white jasmine-scented flowers. When the flowers fall from the trees, a small cherry cluster forms and ripens to a red, ripe fruit. The process, from flower to harvest, takes about nine months.

<p> Cascara (Outer Skin and Pulp)

<p> : The outer skin is thick and slightly bitter in flavor, while the pulp (fruit) directly beneath is sweet and has the texture of a grape.

<p> Mucilage

<p> : This layer is slippery and thin, and covers the parchment.

<p> Parchment

<p> : The protective layer of the coffee bean and silver skin.

<p> Silver Skin

<p> : The coffee beans are coated in a very thin layer called silver skin.

<p> Green Bean

<p> : Nestled in the center of the coffee cherry are two green coffee beans.

<p> Smoked Butterscotch Latte

<p> Smoked Butterscotch Latte is also returning to stores this winter. The beverage, which was

<p> first introduced in stores

<p> in 2016, combines espresso with steamed milk and smoked butterscotch sauce, finished with a sprinkling of smoky butterscotch topping.

<p> The smoky flavor balances the subtle sweetness of the butterscotch. It acts as a savory ingredient that enhances the coffee.
