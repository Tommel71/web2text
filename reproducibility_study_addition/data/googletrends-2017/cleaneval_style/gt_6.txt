<p> Warning: this article contains spoilers for the season one finale of

<p> The Good Doctor.

<p> The second season of ABC's

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> has unleashed a new trailer on the world, and it teases more of the fallout facing Freddie Highmore's Dr Shaun Murphy and his mentor Dr Aaron Glassman (Richard Schiff) following on from

<p> the season one finale

<p> .

<p> During the emotional episode, Shaun

<p> made a huge error in surgery that nearly proved fatal for one of his patient and both he and Aaron – who'd put his job on the line to have to Shaun at the hospital – were preparing to admit their mistake to Dr Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper), with both their futures left up in the air.

<p> "The only question I have is: who exactly is to blame?" Dr Andrews asks at the beginning of the new trailer, and it doesn't look like things will get any easier for anyone from there.

<p> In the clip, Shaun is told that things will get "more difficult" for him now.

<p> "I was honest," he tells Dr Claire Browne (Antonia Thomas). "It just made it worse."

<p> The trailer also shares a look at Dr Glassman's cancer storyline after season one revealed that his inoperable brain cancer – which would have given him a short window to live – was actually a low-grade glioma that can be treated.

<p> Glassman can be seen searching for the best oncologist and determined to do everything he can to treat his cancer, but he also suffers his moments of doubt too.

<p> "I am damn smart," he says. "I am a damn good surgeon. And if I can't be those things then I don't know who I'd be."

<p> Previously, show creator

<p> David Shore shared what viewers could expect from the second season

<p> , hinting that Glassman's diagnosis and treatment will present many challenges to the team at St. Bonaventure hospital.

<p> "This is a show about medicine, and we have guest stars come in and get sick and get better and whatever," he explained. "How do our people deal with that? How is Dr Glassman going to deal with his illness going forward?

<p> "How is Dr Murphy going to deal with a sick mentor? What is that going to do to their relationship? What challenges is that going to present? I want to fully explore that."

<p> The Good Doctor

<p> will return on Monday, September 24 on ABC in the US next month.
