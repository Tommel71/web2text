Copyright 1995 by□Gary L. Francione. Portions of this article are taken
from the book Rain□Without Thunder. Footnotes are omitted.□□□□□□□□□CRITERION #1: An Incremental Change Must Constitute a Prohibition□□□□□□□□□...Thus the first criterion for any incremental change, beyond
the□incremental education of the public about the need to
abolish□institutionalized animal exploitation, is that it must prohibit
some□reasonably identifiable behavior. This prohibition must also
correlate with□the ability of the animal to claim (through a
representative) the protection□of the right.□□□□□□□□□The requirement that there be a prohibition, and not merely a
regulation□that requires "humane" treatment, is sometimes phrased as
requiring the□"abolition" of a particular practice. Although this is a
correct description□of the matter, it can cause confusion by equating
the abolition of□institutionalized animal exploitation with incremental
measures that, it is□hoped, will lead to that abolition. On the first
level of moral theory,□animal rights theory is clearly "abolitionist"
in that its long-term goal is□the complete eradication of
institutionalized animal exploitation. What we□are examining now is
whether there are adequate criteria that can be used to□identify
incremental means to the long-term goal.□□□□□□□□□To say that the incremental means must themselves be "abolitionist"
is□correct if the definition includes prohibitions against
reasonably□identifiable conduct which, if engaged in, would constitute
a failure to□respect a particular animal interest. But these
incremental means are by□definition not "abolitionist" in the sense
that no one incremental□prohibition will effect the long-term goal of
ending animal slavery. In□order to avoid confusion, it is better to
reserve the use of "abolition" for□the long-term goal of rights theory,
and "prohibition" as one criterion of□incremental measures that seek to
realize that long-term goal....□□□□□□□□□CRITERION #2: There Must Be a Prohibition of an Identifiable Activity
That□is Constitutive of the Exploitative Institution
□□□□Consider the following proposals:
□□□□Proposal 1: Reduce the number of hens confined in a battery cage
(usually□floor space is a twelve inch square) from four hens to three
hens.
□□□□Proposal 2: Criminalize the use of animals in drug addiction
experiments.
□□□□These proposals cannot be distinguished using the first criterion
alone,□because, for the reasons stated above, both of these can be
considered to□involve prohibitions. Although Proposal 2 accords more
with the notion of a□prohibition, Proposal 1 can be conceptualized as a
prohibition on keeping□four chickens in a cage.□□□□□□□□□This is not to say, however, that there are no distinctions between
Proposal□1 and Proposal 2. With respect to the criminalization of the
use of animals□in a certain type of experiment, a particular activity
that is constitutive□of the general practice of vivisection has been
stopped.□□□□□□□□□...[E]ven if the elimination of the battery cage and the substitution
of the□small hen house constitute a prohibition of an activity (i.e.,
the use of□the battery cage), that proposal implicates the problem that
the change□nevertheless continues to sanction the exploitation of the
hens, albeit in a□different form.□□□□□□□□□CRITERION #3: The Prohibition of a Constitutive Activity Must
Recognize and□Respect a Non-Institutional Animal Interest□□□□□□□□□Although there is some controversy over whether animals can be said to
have□"interests," as has been discussed elsewhere, for good reasons,
most people,□including those who exploit animals, regard nonhumans as
having a wide range□of interests. The law supposedly protects animal
interests. The problem is□that for the most part, these interests are
those that facilitate the□exploitation of animals for a particular
property use. For example, the law□protects the interests of animals
used in experiments to the extent□necessary to ensure that the animal
produces data of the quality considered□acceptable by research
scientists. Indeed, those who support the use of□animals in experiments
assure the public that "only those animals that are□cared for properly
will be good research subjects,"  and that the federal□Animal Welfare
Act and other sources of regulation provide for the requisite□care. In
this sense, each form of institutionalized exploitation will have□rules
about the "humane" care of animals that are tailored to that□particular
use of animal property and that reflect the particular concerns□of that
exploitative activity.□□□□□□□□□To the extent that we seek the incremental eradication of the
property□status of animals, it is necessary that there is a
corresponding recognition□of the interests of animals in not being
regarded as property, or, as Regan□would say, in not being treated
exclusively as a means to human ends. ...To□eradicate the property
status of animals, there must be a recognition of an□interest that is
noninstitutional, or that is not simply an interest that□ensures the
animal is used "wisely" in a context of exploitation. It is
only□through recognition of extra or noninstitutional interests that
incremental□eradication of property status can be achieved; recognition
of institutional□interests, such as the interest of a turkey destined
for slaughter in being□fed, merely reinforces and supports the property
status of animals. ...□□□□□□□□□CRITERION #4: Animal Interests Cannot Be "Tradable"□□□□□□□□□...If there is to be an incremental eradication of the property status
of□animals, then there must be a recognition that animals have
interests that□go beyond those interests that must be respected if we
are to exploit□animals efficiently. And, following the second salient
assumption of animal□rights theory, these non-institutional interests
cannot be tradable just□because the aggregation of consequences
indicates that the trade is□justified to secure the human "benefit."
Indeed, animals are property□precisely because animals have no
interests (beyond those that must be□observed if the animals are to
serve their "purpose" as our property) that□are safe from being
balanced away as soon as some human "benefit" is□identified.□□□□□□□□□In one sense, this criterion seeks to ensure that the
incremental□eradication of property status is indeed an incremental
"assembly" of□personhood status for nonhumans through the recognition
of the inherent□value of animals. At present, we do not recognize
animals as having any□value except for their value to us. For example,
philosopher Joseph Raz□claims that although animals may have some value
apart from their□instrumental use to people, animals cannot have
inherent value because any□value of the animal ultimately derives from
the animal's contribution to the□happiness and well-being of some human
or humans, who do have inherent□value.□ Raz's views are representative
of many people's views. The fourth□criterion ensures that each
incremental move provides for and protects some□notion of the inherent
value of animals.□□□□□□□□□In one sense, this criterion could be said to address the
enforceability of□protection for recognized interests. One could say
that under slavery as□practiced in the United States, there were some
laws that seemed to□recognize that slaves had interests other than ones
directly related to□keeping a slave alive and fit for whatever purpose
the slave was intended.□For the most part, however, these interests
were ignored whenever they□conflicted with the interests of the master
whose property rights were held□to outweigh the slave's interests. If
animal interests are to be taken□seriously, then, to the extent that
the law regulates the use of animal□property beyond what is necessary
to exploit the animal property, that□regulation must be held as
eliminating the property right to the extent□necessary to protect the
interest. Otherwise, the victory for animals will□be illusory; as soon
as the rights of human property owners are triggered,□the animal
interest will be ignored.□□□□□□□□□Accordingly, the interest of the animal must be seen explicitly as
an□interest that is to be protected as would a true "right" within the
legal□system. The interest would not be a "right" in the full sense in
that since□animals would not yet possess the basic right not to be
regarded as property□(they would still be used for food and in
experiments), they would have□nonbasic rights that could be said to be
building blocks of the basic right□not to be property. These nonbasic
rights must, however, be treated as□though they were rights in the
sense that they will be regarded as□protecting interests that are not
subject to interest balancing.□□□□□□□□□To protect animal interests in this manner would require a very
deliberate□and intentional recognition of a type of legal norm that our
legal system□does not yet recognize: a norm that functions like a true
right in that it□recognizes an interest that cannot be balanced away,
but that is held by a□being who has not yet achieved the status of
being a holder of the basic□right not to be regarded exclusively as a
means to an end. Indeed, every□time we recognize such a right, we move
away from treating the being□exclusively as a means to human ends; the
problem is that the being's most□fundamental interests in not being
eaten or used in experiments or kept in a□zoo have not yet been
recognized. These incremental measures may be seen,□however, as
recognizing pieces of the basic right not to be regarded as□property.
So, although these interests represent nonbasic rights in one□sense
(the animal does not yet by definition have the basic right of
not□being property), the interests are more properly regarded as
"parts" of the□basic right of animals not to be treated exclusively as
means to human ends.□□□□□□□□□..In order to recognize that animals have such interests, it is
necessary□that these interests be understood as trumping the interests
of property□owners. And in order to be effective, it would be necessary
for the legal□system to recognize that it is animals who hold this
interest, and not their□owners or government agencies, such as the
USDA, which protects only□those animal interests that make animals
property in the first place. It□would be necessary to recognize that
animals (or, more properly□speaking, the guardians of animals) have
standing to articulate these□interests against property owners, which
would functionally require that□some sort of guardian be recognized.□□□□□□□□□Because animals are regarded as property, and property is, by
definition and□several hundred years of accepted understanding, that
which cannot have□legal relations with persons or other property,
courts have developed□doctrines that preclude animals or their
surrogates from articulating their□interests in courts of law and
before regulatory agencies. This exclusion is□based on the supposed
inability (in terms of the power of the court) to□adjudicate claims
made by property or those who purport to represent that□property. So,
if the ... non-institutional interests of animals are to
be□non-tradable, then those interests, which must be seen as
recognizing□"minitrumps" of the property rights of animal owners, must
be protected by□the legal system. This will require that animal
interests have legal□standing and that some human actor (and this could
be the police) have□standing to articulate those claims before the
appropriate body. This is, of□course, not a new idea. In Should Trees
Have Standing? -- Toward Legal□Rights for Natural Objects, Christopher
Stone argued that the inherent value□of nonhumans could be recognized
and protected by guardians just as are the□rights (basic rights and
nonbasic rights) of children or the mentally□disabled.□□□□□□□□□CRITERION #5: The Prohibition Should Not Substitute an Alternative,
and□Supposedly More "Humane" Form of Exploitation□□□□□□□□□This fifth criterion follows from both aspects of rights theory
identified□at the outset of this section: that rights theory requires
eradication of□the property status of animals and that the right of
animals not to be□regarded as property cannot be compromised for
consequential reasons. In□many respects, this fifth criterion is the
most significant of the group□because it often will be the most helpful
in determining whether a proposed□incremental measure is consistent
with rights theory, although, like the□other criteria, this one is not
exact and will not provide an easy answer in□all cases. But then, the
idea is to try to make a morally informed decision,□and not necessarily
one that is always right.□□□□□□□□□The fifth criterion holds that it is inconsistent with rights theory
to□treat some animals exclusively as means to the ends of others, or
as□property, in order to secure some benefit that it is hoped will
eventually□secure a higher moral status for other animals. This is a
serious problem□for the new welfarist who purports to endorse the
long-term goal of animal□rights by using short-term welfarist reforms
as a means to the end of□abolition of institutionalized exploitation.□□□□□□□□□The new welfarist disregards the inherent value of some animals in
order to□secure a benefit for other animals. For example, the federal
Animal Welfare□Act provides that animals  may be used in biomedical
experiments as long as□their use is "humane" and they are not forced to
suffer "unnecessarily." The□new welfarists, who supported the 1985
amendments to the Act, believe that□the Act will itself reduce animal
suffering, but more importantly, that laws□like the Act are "stepping
stones" to the future recognition and respect of□animals other than the
ones whose interests are now being ignored. This□Article argued earlier
that there is simply no way to determine whether laws□like the Act
actually reduce animal suffering, and that, given the□structural
defects of welfare theory generally, such laws will generally be□held
only to require that conduct that facilitates the use of the animal
as□property. Apart from the rather puzzling logic of how we get to
a□non-property status of animals by persistent reinforcement of the
property□paradigm, there is something objectionable on a theoretical
level when a□rights advocate explicitly endorses the property status of
animals as a way□of eradicating that status on an incremental basis.□□□□□□□□□...So, for example, a complete prohibition on the use of chimpanzees
in□certain procedures can reasonably be said to constitute the
prohibition of a□constitutive activity, but to the extent that the
advocate urges or accepts□that other animals, such as dogs, should be
used instead...such a rule would□violate the fundamental proscription
against speciesism.
□□□□In order to understand more fully the point of this fifth
criterion,□consider the following example: animal advocates propose to
lobby for a law□the preamble of which explicitly recognizes that
animals have moral□interests and the current configuration of battery
hens per cage disrespects□those moral interests. The body of the law
provides that in recognition of□the interests that hens have, no more
than two shall be placed in battery□cages, and these cages shall be
enlarged to provide 196 inches of floorspace□rather than 144 inches.
The egg industry objects to this arrangement□vehemently as it is
"unnecessary" to maximize the value of animal property□and will, in
fact, impose a very significant cost on the ownership of
animal□property in this context. The law provides that this interest
must be□protected irrespective of the economic consequences and
contains penalties□to ensure that the interests are not recognized
subject to complete□defeasance through a claim of human "benefit."□□□□□□□□□The traditional welfarist would undoubtedly support this measure
because it□will, in the welfarist's view, reduce animal suffering. The
new welfarist,□who seeks as a long-term goal the abolition of animal
exploitation, will□also undoubtedly support this, not only because it
will supposedly reduce□suffering, but because it is a "stepping stone"
or "springboard" into□abolition at some future time. The new welfarist
and the traditional□welfarist have the same view -- that the measure
will reduce suffering --□but the new welfarist, unlike the traditional
welfarist, believes that□because the measure will reduce suffering, it
will act as an incremental□measure on the road to the long-term goal.□□□□□□□□□The animal rights advocate first dismisses the view that avoiding pain
and□suffering are the only interests that animals (human or nonhuman)
have. If□pain and suffering were the only relevant moral interests,
then what would□prevent us from using small numbers of "undesirable"
humans to eradicate□large amounts of human pain and suffering?
Obviously, although we all have□strong interests in avoiding pain and
suffering, we do limit the ways in□which pain and suffering can be
alleviated so as to respect other□interests -- such as the rights of
humans (and nonhumans) -- as well.□Second, the rights advocate
dismisses the new welfarist view, also□articulated by Singer, that a
measure that reduces pain and suffering will□lead to incremental
achievement of the long-term goal of equal consideration□for equal
interests (Singer) or the abolition of all
institutionalized□exploitation (Regan) simply because it supposedly
reduces pain and□suffering. The rights advocate knows that some
measures that supposedly□reduce pain and suffering will do nothing more
than assure that animals□receive protection that is consistent with
their status as property, and□that facilitates their use as particular
types of property.□□□□□□□□□The rights advocate begins by asking whether the proposal contains
a□prohibition or a regulation, and concludes that the proposal
prohibits□keeping more than two hens in the cage. She is unclear as to
whether, even□if the proposal is a prohibition, it constitutes a
prohibition of an□activity that is constitutive of the overall form of
exploitation. She errs□in favor of regarding the measure as prohibiting
a constitutive activity.□She is clear, however, that the proposal
provides for the recognition of an□interest that is extra-institutional
in that it provides for the recognition□of an interest that is not tied
to the property status of the hens. The□proposal recognizes that the
hens have inherent value beyond their status as□property, which would
justify only that level of regulation that facilitated□animal use.
Moreover, the proposal provides that these interests cannot be□traded
away and constitute proto-rights.□□□□□□□□□The problem with the proposal is that it is, on its face, not
only□consistent with the status of animals as property that, as a
general matter,□lacks inherent value, but does so in a way that
explicitly trades away the□basic right of the hens not to be property
in favor of a recognition of□moral status that falls short of
recognition of the basic right, or the□complete protection of some
interest that the animal has in, for example,□bodily movement. By
agreeing to the two-hen arrangement, animal advocates□are trying to
achieve proto-rights while at the same time endorsing an□alternative
form of exploitation -- two hens in a cage -- that is supposedly□more "humane."□□□□□□□□□In the present case, it seems reasonable to say that the interest
involved□is the interest that the hens have -- all of them -- in not
being in the□battery cage in the first place and in having freedom of
movement that is□appropriate to the species. To the extent that the
proposal recognizes and□respects that interest, then the prohibition
arguably does not substitute□another form of exploitation and is
acceptable. That is, assume that a□prohibition abolishes the battery
cage entirely and replaces it with a□rearing system that accommodates
all of the hen's interests in freedom of□movement and thereby fully
recognizes the interest of the hen's bodily□integrity. Such a state of
affairs may be another way of saying that the□prohibition ends a
particular form of exploitation that has violated a□particular
non-institutional, non-tradable interest that we have now decided□to
respect. But this sort of substitution differs considerably from
merely□removing two of the hens from the cage in that although we have
not yet□abolished the institutionalized exploitation, the substitution
eliminates□the exploitation involved in the confinement system through
a full□recognition of the interest of the hens in their freedom of
movement.□□□□□□□□□In any event, any substitution of exploitation raises serious
questions for□the rights advocate. If the incremental eradication of
the property status□of animals is going to be consistent with rights
theory, it is important□that proposed measures not substitute one form
of exploitation for another,□supposedly more "humane" form of
exploitation. Oftentimes, the alternative□form of exploitation will
provide in general terms for "humane" treatment,□which then feeds the
whole matter right back through the mechanisms of legal□welfarism
which, as argued before, are structurally defective and□systematically
devalue animal interests. But even if the substitute form
of□exploitation is more definite (i.e., there shall be no more than two
birds□per cage), and even if the proposal recognizes that the animals
have some□inherent value that justifies the recognition of a
non-institutional,□non-tradable interest, that recognition comes at the
expense of endorsing□another form of exploitation that rests on the
legitimacy of the status of□animals as property. This sacrifices the
moral right of the animal not to be□property for a proto-right that is
designed to effect the incremental□eradication of property status. The
substitution of exploitation raises□issues of moral conflict with
rights theory, and incoherence in light of the□fundamental assumptions
of that theory.□□□□□□□□□This discussion does serve, however, to demonstrate that as a
practical□matter, certain campaigns will be difficult for animal rights
advocates to□pursue if they agree with this fifth criterion. It seems
that the rights□advocate really has no choice but to condemn any form
of substitute□exploitation, unless that alternative arrangement
completely eradicates an□activity constitutive of animal exploitation
through the full recognition of□relevant animal interests. The animal
advocate must not herself suggest an□alternative, and must not agree to
any alternative offered by the exploiter.□To do either would involve
the rights advocate sacrificing the basic right□of animals not to be
property in order to secure a less-than-basic□proto-right that, while
it does recognize and respect that animals have□person-like interests
that transcend their status as property, is achieved□at the cost of
reinforcing the notion that a "better" system of animal□slavery is
acceptable. These considerations would militate in favor of□conducting
the sort of campaign that may not succeed (at least initially),□but
that will have a potentially powerful effect on educating members of
the□public about animal exploitation. And in many respects, such
education,□whether sought directly in the classroom or as part of a
militant campaign□such as one that supports a law to demand the end of
the egg battery and□that urges no substitute form of exploitation
(rather than a reactionary and□conservative welfarist campaign to make
