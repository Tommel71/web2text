Minor in Education□□□□□□□□□□□The Program□□□□□□□□□The Teacher Education Institute does not offer a program leading to an
undergraduate degree, however it does offer undergraduate students a
minor in education that introduces students to the profession of
education and provides students an opportunity to explore education as
a career and obtain a head start on their coursework leading to
initial teacher certification through the University at Buffalos
graduate school program, but □□□□□□□□this minor cannot in itself lead directly
to teacher certification□□□□□□□□□.□□□□□□□□□Although intended for those who will pursue certification in
Adolescence education (Grades 7-12), the minor can be adapted for
those interested in Early Childhood Education (birth to Grade 2)
and/or Childhood Education (Grades 1-6).□□□□□□□□□Acceptance Criteria□□□□□□□□□Registration is open to students who formally apply to the minor and
who receive confirmation of acceptance prior to registration.

Applications to the minor must be filed with the Teacher Education
Institution (TEI) office in 375 Baldy Hall.  Applications must include
UB DARS report and/or official transcripts from all institutions
attended other than UB.  Students must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 for
admission.
□□□□□□□□□Course Sequence□□□□□□□□□The minor in education consists of 19 credits as described below.□□□□□□□□□Required Courses□□□□□□□□□Educational Foundations (10 credits):□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□LAI □350□□□□□□□□ Introduction to Education (4 credit hours)

□□□□□□□
Spring: LAI 414 or elective
□□□□□□□□□
Third Year□□□□□□□□□Fall: Two courses from the list of electives□□□□□□□□□The first course (LAI 350) in the minor is an introductory course that
is not part of the required coursework for certification.  It does,
however, have a field experience component, and early field
experiences are required in the latest NYS Education Department
regulations.
□□□□□□□□The next two courses, CEP 400 and ELP 405, can be used to meet
requirements for initial certification as an Adolescence teacher.  The
final three courses in the minor are electives, which may also meet
teacher certification course requirements (depending upon which
curricular option the student eventually pursues).□□□□□□□□□Students who take CEP 400, ELP 405, and LAI 414, and complete them
successfully, and who later pursue a UB program leading to initial
teacher certification at the Adolescence level may include these
courses in their coursework toward initial certification (but not the
masters degree).  This allows students to have a 9-credit head start
toward their initial certification.□□□□□□□□□Provisional Admission into the Teacher Certification Program□□□□□□□□□Students who have completed 75 undergraduate credits in an approved
major with a minimum GPA of 3.0 can apply on-line to an initial
certification (i.e., advanced certificate without an Ed.M. degree) or
initial/professional certification program (with Ed.M. degree) for
provisional admission pending completion of their undergraduate
degree.  Students who have been provisionally admitted and who have
completed 90 undergraduate credits may take two graduate level
education courses (upon advisement) and include them in their graduate
program in education.
