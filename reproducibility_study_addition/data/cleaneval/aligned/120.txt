Hacks travelling to the island for the Olympics 2012 announcement have

Even better, they have been told chewing gum is only permitted on
medical prescription.

And to put the cap on it all, they have been reminded that spitting in
public is also an offence.

After all the usual stuff about Africa, the election, etcetera,

talking about the (for which most read "his")  "historic fourth term".

One of the great symbolic modernisations of the Tories under Michael
Howard was to move the party out of its old Smith Square headquarters
into a glistening new office over Starbucks.
□□□
Apart from giving the party an up-to-date image, the aim was to flog
off the Smith Square building to raise cash for party coffers.
□□□
Except no one wants to buy it. Apparently the fading and warren-like
interior needs a thorough makeover.
□□□
So much so that one insider whispered the party may even have to move
back in.
□□□
What sort of message would that send out?

St James' Park is close to his Westminster residence and one of the
ducks recently delivered a fine clutch of chicks in his garden.

Three of the ducklings hardly had time to squeak before they became
Magpie food, but three have survived and, I'm told, have become the
apple of Mr Duncan's eye.

One of the great mysteries of the general election campaign was over
exactly who it was who phoned Home Secretary Charles Clarke on his
mobile when he was standing on stage alongside the prime minister
during the Labour manifesto launch.
□□□
The incident brought some much-needed light relief to the proceedings
which, you may remember, resembled TV's The Weakest Link.
□□□
Well, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has finally confessed, during a
lunch for political journalists, that  it was her. Or, more accurately,
it was her ageing driver, Eddie, who was ferrying her around during
the campaign.
□□□
He was provided with a car, mobile phone and satellite navigation
system for the campaign,  but had absolutely no idea how to use the sat
nave kit.
□□□
As he was driving the minister to the manifesto launch at London's
Mermaid Theatre he became hopelessly lost. So Ms Kelly borrowed his
phone to contact her friend Charles Clarke who guided them to the
venue before the event kicked off.
□□□
Unfortunately when it was time for the driver to return to pick up his
passenger he once again became lost.
□□□
Luckily he still had the mobile phone and knew how to use the redial
last number button - much to Mr Clarke's embarrassment.

At the start of last week's EU summit, before tempers snapped  and
personal insults started flying across the Channel, the prime minister
was happy enough to aim a small joke in Jacques Chirac's direction.
□□□
Asked about the French President's attendance at the looming G8 summit
in Gleneagles, Mr Blair said he was happy to announce M Chirac would
be there.
□□□
But he only persuaded him to come by reassuring him he would not have
to wear "le kilt", joked Mr Blair.
□□□
Er, well that's not quite how it has turned out. It now appears the
President expects to remain in Singapore to celebrate Paris' expected
victory in the 2012 Olympics bid  - so will miss the first day of the
summit.
□□□
Indeed, there are even those suggesting he will stay in Singapore even
if Paris doesn't win, just to embarrass the prime minister. Unless, of
course, London wins.

Most people would be understandably flattered to discover they have
been included in a reference work.
□□□
But Commons leader and former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon was
probably less than delighted when his Tory opposite number Chris
Grayling pointed out he had made it into a dictionary.
□□□
Unfortunately it is the online cockney rhyming slang dictionary which
declares Geoff Hoon can now be taken as slang for baboon, as in
"you're a right Geoff Hoon you are".
□□□
I should be careful about pointing this out Mr Grayling - your name
does, after all, rhyme with failing.

One of the events during a dinner to mark the 30th anniversary of her
election as Tory leader was an auction to raise cash for the hosts,
Conservative Way Forward.
□□□
Top prize was a cup of tea on the House of Lords' terrace with the
great Lady herself.
□□□
The bids just kept on coming - and ended with the lucky winner
pledging a stunning 6,100.00 for the privilege.
□□□
Do I hear any bids for a skinny latte with the prime minister?

It's been a pretty good week for Liberal Democrat leader Charles
Kennedy.
□□□
Not only has all the talk about leadership challenges in the wake of
his less-than-hoped-for election performance evaporated, but one of
his political predictions appears to be coming true.
□□□
Firstly, and you can be forgiven for not noticing, he has been
re-elected as party leader - if that is the right phrase in the
absence of an actual vote or challenge.
□□□
Secondly a new opinion poll has suggested that public support for ID
cards has started to slide dramatically from around 80% to 55%, just
as Mr Kennedy has always claimed it would.
□□□
Now one poll may not signify anything, but it comes amid growing
whispers that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is desperately seeking a
way of averting a Commons defeat over the issue when it comes back
before MPs in the next couple of weeks.
□□□
And if that happens, as with Iraq, Mr Kennedy will claim he is the
only party leader to have consistently opposed the policy.

The government is, as we all know, committed to freedom of information
- and it expects all Whitehall departments to do their bit.
□□□
Even the once hugely-secretive Ministry of Defence is on board and has
part of its website devoted to telling people how to use the system to
get the information they want.
□□□
Unfortunately for one colleague it didn't quite work like that.
□□□
First he rang the MoD to ask about how to obtain information under the
FOI rules.
□□□
The switchboard attempted to put him through to a number which did not
work.
□□□
So he was given another number to dial himself. That connected to one
of those infernal disembodied voices which directed him to yet another
number.
□□□
When that was dialled he was greeted with the message that the number
could not be recognised. At which point he gave up.
□□□
Only a temporary tickle on the freedom front I'm sure.

A bit late in the day perhaps, but I have only just heard of a great
wheeze deployed by ex-Tory election boss, Lynton Crosby, to keep
morale high among the party's staff during the election campaign.
□□□
He handed out daily prizes for all sorts of things other than simply
good performance. For example, on one occasion the award was for the
best mobile phone tone.
□□□
The budget for this scheme was quite low, however, so the prizes were
modest, but imaginative, and were sometimes awarded for only a day.
□□□
The bottle of beer was, understandably, non returnable, but the
booklet of the "60 most appalling lefties" had to be returned once
read.
□□□
More alarmingly, so did the Union Jack G string. Whether it was put to
use before being returned for re-awarding is a question too far.
□□□
At the end of the campaign it was retrieved from the last winner,
framed and handed back to Mr Crosby with a note of thanks signed by
party staff.

One of the more pleasant events of the parliamentary calendar is the
journalists' reception for new MPs, which took place last night.
□□□
This tradition is aimed partly at showing the new intake what a
thoroughly friendly, trustworthy and sober bunch we all are.
□□□
But it is hard not to get the impression that some of the MPs have
come along simply to put a face to the names of those they expect to
be their future tormentors - or at whose hands they believe they may
have already suffered.
□□□
Still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and, hopefully useful event.
□□□
As the splendid chairman of the press gallery, John Hipwood declared
at the end of his welcoming speech to the MPs: "Remember, we are here
to help."

Staff and MPs returning from the short Whitsun recess have been
greeted by signs telling them where they are no longer allowed to
smoke.
□□□
No great surprise there as there has been a continuing programme of
gradually turning the Palace of Westminster into a smoke free zone.
□□□
But what surprised and even angered some was the rule banning people
from lighting up outdoors if they were in sight of members of the
public.
□□□
Presumably the powers that be think it would not present the right
image to tourists visiting the mother of parliaments to see little
knots of people hanging around the precincts shrouded in clouds of
smoke.
□□□
The rules state quite bluntly that any member of staff found puffing
away in front of the public will be reported to their line manager.
Persistent offenders will face disciplinary action.
□□□
It is not clear whether these restrictions apply to MPs - they would
never seek privileges ahead of members of staff would they?
□□□
Still I would love to witness the first occasion one of the security
staff attempts to stop an MP lighting up in full view of the public.

They will never admit it, but there are those in the government who
are revelling in Jacques Chirac's discomfort over his country's "No"
vote on the constitution.
□□□
Relations between Britain and France have always been on a
rollercoaster and there have been some serious fallings out over the
years.
□□□
And there are many in the Foreign Office and Downing Street who find
President Chirac both arrogant and overbearing.
□□□
Could this have anything to do with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's
refusal to pronounce the EU constitution well and truly dead?
□□□
One very senior FCO figured whispered: "We will leave it to Mr Chirac
to kill off the constitution. That will be exquisite."
□□□
So, diplomatic relations back to normal then.

The ex Tory Chairman, once branded the "Chingford skinhead" and before
whom lesser politicians cowered, has stepped into the row over Michael
Howard's leadership.
□□□
Asked who he fancied as the next Tory boss, he revealed he had had
himself cloned.
□□□
The carbon copy Tebbit is currently too young to take over the job, he
declared, but his moment would come.

So which youngster on the Tory benches has this particular big beast's
DNA running through him?

Probably not the current MP for Chingford - one Iain Duncan Smith.

When the prime minister announced election day all those weeks ago he
was wearing a rather fetching red tie with blue frog motif.
□□□
Nothing particularly odd about that. Either he was doing it to win a
bet or more likely, as any father will instantly confirm, because it
was a present from one of his children - presumably whichever has the
most well developed sense of humour.
□□□
But wait, what's this. The very same tie made another appearance on
the day the prime minister was returned to Downing Street for his
dreamt of historic third election victory.
□□□
Is this superstition, does the blue frog have magical powers, is there
some hidden symbolism?
□□□
The most famous, or infamous,  blue frog is the unsurprisingly named
blue poison arrow frog found only in a remote area of the South
American rain forest.
□□□
It is known as highly territorial, aggressive and, needless to say,
poisonous to its enemies.
□□□
