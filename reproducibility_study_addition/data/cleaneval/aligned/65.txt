system security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simply
part of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form of
monitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.
For me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'
projects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-time
connection to the Internet.□□□□□□□□□As Lead Coordinator of □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□the
Bastille Linux Project□□□□, a hardening script
for Red Hat Linux, I thought my job was to make Linux more secure so
beginning users could easily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux
users have no experience as system administrators or often even any
experience with Unix. I thought the best way to tackle the problem was
to make it easy to do the right thing.□□□□□□□□□Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux system
security by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away:
Does Linux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than
other operating systems? Is open-source software inherently less
secure than commercial systems?□□□□□□□□□I usually begin by explaining that more holes are reported in
open-source software □□□□before□□□□□ they're exploited, and that the number of
actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less -- than
commercial software. I explain that one reason there are so many
break-ins into Linux systems is that there are so many Linux systems
on the Internet, and I explain that Linux can be as secure as any
other operating system.□□□□□□□□□But Linux does have a security problem. It's not a universal problem,
but look at the following list of security Web sites, mailing lists,
and update tools for some common Linux distributions:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Red Hat Linux

general audience; at the least, they're not aiming at the router
market or the embedded devices market. These are all products intended
to be used by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or
even the Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but
I'm a fairly advanced user myself, and I still expect that my software
distributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That's
one of the reasons I don't roll my own distribution.□□□□□□□□□
Of the eight common distributions I could think of, three have nothing
whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of the others didn't
seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has a security
problem: while those four distributions have probably less than a
quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profile
distributions which garner more than their share of media coverage.□□□□□□□□□These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're
damaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every
time I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have to
consider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can answer.
These distributions' total lack of concern with security is an
embarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities.□□□□□□□□□Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reporters that
many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little the average
user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount of time
to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security, as I
am. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work. These
people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work to do.□□□□□□□□□If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems
wouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems
have been exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than
a year old, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a
professional, I know that they shouldn't even be running it, because I
know that they're not using it. But I can't expect them to know, and I
can't even fix it myself: I didn't know that some of these machines
existed until I found out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users
to read a single, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty
good solution -- when those lists exist.□□□□□□□□□Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't
provide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a
Web site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these
distributions not because they necessarily need the security notices
for themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux's
image not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors who
shape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution.□□□□□□□□□You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less if
businesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you lose
nothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when security
updates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing when
businesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered to
package up an already publicly-available solution to a security hole.□□□□□□□□□The rest of us do lose.  It hurts our professional reputations when we
stand behind a piece of software with frequent and highly-publicized
security lapses.  It wastes our time, tracking down hacked user
machines for which we're not responsible and rebuilding them from the
ground up.  It wastes our money, when businesses and government
agencies buy more expensive hardware and software for the illusion of
security.□□□□□□□□□Solving this problem isn't difficult or time consuming; simply pick
distributions which express a basic level of concern for security
issues, and let vendors know -- at trade shows, in e-mail, in letters
to the editor of your favorite publication -- that security isn't just

Ok, then, let me take the car analogy one step further that that ...□□□
Windows Vehicle:
□□□□□□□□□You turn on your machine, it boots Windows, you hit the Start
button,□you chose a program, it runs. □If there's a problem, an "engine problem"□indicator lights up on the dashboard.□□□□□□□□□□You get in your Geo, put the key in the ignition, turn it on, put
the□gearshift in Drive, step on the gas, and go. □If there's a problem, a□"General Fault" message pops up on the screen.□□□□□□□□□□□
Linux Vehicle:
□□□□□□□□□You turn on your machine, it boots Linux/BSD/Solaris/FooNIX, you
watch□the startup messages for any errors, you type in your login
and password,□you get a shell prompt, maybe you type "startx" to
get a nice GUI. □You□now have your choice of hudreds of commands,
tools, utilities, compilers,□editors, and apps to bring to bear on
the problem at hand. □If there's a□problem, a core file and a ton of
log messages are spewed out to tell the□user exactly what part
broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise□the stability of
the rest of the system.□□□□□□□□□□You step out on the flight line, do a thorough walkaround of your
F-22□checking for any potential problems, hop in the cockpit, enter
your□authentication code, crank up the turbines, taxi out to the
end of the□runway, get clearance from the tower, and take off. □You now have your□choice of hundreds of possible maneuvers, and a wide
array of avionics,□ECM, and weaponry to bring to bear on the
problem at hand. □If there's a□problem, diagnostic information gets
spewed out at the pilot to tell him□exactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise the□airworthiness of the
aircraft.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
The driver of the Geo doesn't need to know how the engine works, or
how to□repair it, in order to get from point A to poing B. □That's what the□mechanic is for. □If there's a problem, an "engine problem" indicator□lights up on the dashboard.□□□
Likewise, the driver of the F-22 doesn't need to know how the
radar,□avionics, and engine work, or how to repair them, in order to
shoot down□the other guy.  That's what the ground crew is for.□□□
The persond driving F-22, however, must have a great deal more
knowledge□of and competence in the physics involved in maneuvering the
vehicle than□the driver of the Geo.□□□
The "driver" of the Windows box doesn't need to know how files are
stored□on disk, or how an interrupt vector tells the CPU that the sound
card□wants some attention.  He does need to know enough to use the
Start->Shut□Down menu item, instead of just turning off the power. □He □□□should□□□□□know enough not to run any .exe files or open any word files
that haven't□been virus scanned.□□□
The "driver" of the Linux box doesn't need to know what an inode is,
or□how System V IPC works.  He does need to know how to log on and
off□properly, and how to read basic error messages that show up on
the□console, how to use the shutdown command. He □□□should□□□□ know the basics□of configuring and compiling a kernel, and locking down
inetd.conf and the□rc.* files.□□□
In a corporate environment, most of the more complicated stuff for
either□system is handled by the IT staff.  They take care of things
like□firewalls at the edge of the corporate network, and shutting off
telnet,□ftp, rpc, and other such things on machines that don't need
them up.□□□
At home, it's a different story.  Someone using a computer at home is
most□likely either dialing a modem in to an ISP, or connecting full
time with an□ISDN or DSL link. (Unless they're a total geek, and have
set up their own□10.0.0.0 network behind a dedicated
NAT-ing/Firewalling box ...)□□□
Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves
at by□doing this without installing and configuring security tools.
□Even a□simple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a
system□compromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line
out of the□wall when a port scan is detected by it.  I have little
sympathy for□people who's machines get compromised due to their own
ignorance and□incompetence. □□□□Anyone□□□□ running a computer that's attatched
to the□'net needs to take the time to learn how to secure it. (By
"running" I□mean being the person responsible for it's maintenance, as
in an IT person□for a corporation, or the owner/user of a home
machine.)□□□□□□□□□□□That's just the way it is. If you want Linux for the masses, it must□be idiot proof.□□□□□□□
There's no such thing.□□□□□□□□If no distro makes the idiot proof LAN workstation, then each network
□□□sys admin will have to cook up their own. □□□□□□□
Who's better qualified to cook up a machine config that's suited to
the□local network environment that the local network admin?□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Umm ... let's see ... rpm for RedHat, □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□I've used that one.

No, but it will tell you if you need to install another package that

securing□Linux boxes, can.  It would make a great internship opportunity
for a CS□student looking at getting into network administration ...
□□□
You don't have to have a PhD in Computer Science to be able to use
a□computer safely and effectively, just as you don't need to know
the□physics and engineering of an internal combustion engine to drive a
car□safely and effectively -- but, as with a car or a bandsaw or any

what are you□complaining about?□□□
Most distributions even let you select between a Workstation and a
Server□installation, and adjust what daemons are available by

telnet,□ftp, nfs, and other services, but that's only in accordance
with the UNIX□tradition, where these services are expected to be
available.  If you have□a problem with that, there's always OpenBSD,
which shuts everything except□SSH off by default.□□□

about). In a LAN□setting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that
could never work.□People can be perfectly productive UNIX users without
understanding□anything about inetd.conf. I know I was for years.
□□□□□□□□□For Linux to make it in the corporate world, the boxes need to be
easy□to set up as LAN workstations and easy to keep up to date with
software□patches. One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of
"secure□enough" Linux boxes. In my mind that should be the goal, and
tools like□AutoRPM and Bastille Linux are the right approach.
□□□□□□□□□Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will never□happen

Slimy is correct in saying that I miss the point of the main article
in my□previous post.  I wasn't aiming for it.  I intended the post in
context□with the other replies talking about how there should be a
distro that is□"secure" out of the box.  (I guess I missed that by a
hair, too ;)
□□□
The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing. □The security□of any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function
of the□cluefulness of the admin.  A well run Linux box will be more
secure than a□poorly run OpenBSD install.  A well run NT server will be
more secure that□a shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box.
□□□
Of course, the only way to have a system that is completely secure
from□being hacked on the 'net, is not to have it on the 'net at all.
□Then all□you have to deal with is the security of physical access to
the machine□itself ... we've all seen the draconian measures that

□□□□Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a

Linux□Distributions that I have run across, Slackware and Debian

a security□standpoint, logical. □ For example, installing a telnetd
server by default□is probably not a good idea.  Having it installed and
configured to accept□remote connections by default is horrific!  Yet
this was the case when I□installed Debian 2.1.  Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a
little smarter than this,□but thats not the official release (yet).
□□□□As anyone who has delt with security issues for some time will
tell□you: the best security policy you can adopt is "that which is
not□explicitly allowed is denied".  More distributions need to take this
into□account.
□□□□If I want a telnet server, I will ask for it.  And when I install it,□I
would expect that: at best, it would not aceept connections
from□anywhere until I told it otherwise; at worst, it would accept
local□connections only, until I told it otherwise.

UNIX was not originally
intended□for the "casual" or "home" user ... they just didn't exist in
1969.
□□□□□□□□□Linux, the BSDs, and any UNIX flavor, for that matter, requires
the□user to have a given level of cluefulness.  IMNERHO, this is a Good
Thing.  The plain, simple, ugly truth is that if you don't know what
inetd.conf is□for, if you don't know where your startup scripts are and
how to edit them,□if you don't know how to set up your anonymous FTP
server correctly, etc.□etc. etc. ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be*
*using* *UNIX*!!!!!
□□□□□□□□□The flip side of that is that anyone can easily obtain
the□documentation and learn how to do all of these things, as well as
all the□other tasks required to keep a UNIX system up and running
properly. □This□has the effect (or at least the potential) of raising
the computer□literacy level of the general public.
□□□□□□□□□Sadly, most people think of their computer the same way they
think□about their television set, their microwave, and their car. □The way I see□it, computers are actually more akin to power tools -- if you
don't read□the instructions and/or get proper training in their use,
you're gonna get□hurt.
□□□□□□□□□There are a few simple truths about the Internet as it stands
today□that many, if not most, people overlook:
□□□□□□□□□□□
The Internet, like Downtown(tm), is *NOT* a safe place. □Anyone who□attatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing
themselves at□risk. □There are malicious people out there who want to steal your□information, just like there are malicious people out there
who want to□steal your wallet.  There are Script Kiddies out there who
want to deface□your website, just as there are Junior Gangbangers out
there who want to□tag your house/car/fence/wall/place of business.
□□□□□□□□□□□
You gotta cover your own ass.  Ultimately, your computer's safety□is
your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your
own□responsibility.  Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the
network□secure.□ They also have security guards and alarm systems and
such to keep□the physical premeses physically secured.  At home, you
have locks on your□doors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep
intruders out of your□home.□ I say "help" because the fact remains that
if someone really wants□to break into your house, they will, alarm
system notwithstanding. □The□same is true for computers on the 'net.  If
someone *really* wants to get□in, they will.  There are, however
measures that can be taken to make it□much more difficult.
□□□□□□□□□Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out
for□everybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the
streets□looking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as
effective. □The□fact remains that if you don't know how to spot a
potential mugger, and if□you don't bother learning basic personal
safety practices (like scanning□the area for potential baddies before
unlocking your car door or□approaching your home, or being able to spot
the scratches on the lock and□door frame that indicate forced entry),
you're much more likely to get□mugged than the person who *has*
bothered to learn these things.
□□□□□□□□□Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safety□practices
(like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you're□much
more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned
these□things.
□□□□□□□□□It doesn't take much.  Anyone who has any semblance of
intelligence□higher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to
edit their□inetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons.  Configuring
IPChains is a□piece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO.
□□□□□□□□□I have no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to set□up
a Linux/BSD/UNIX system.  "But Windows just works" is the party line□...
primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install.

They buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which
come□with Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install
Windows on□dozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how
insecure they□are when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go
surfing the net.
□□□□□□□□□At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily
accessible□mechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like
IPChains that allow□them to be made more secure.  At least the users of
these systems know (or□should know) that there are security issues to
be addressed.
□□□□□□□□□□□Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open
to□many attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks
that□take advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments,
JavaScript,□ActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into
their systems.  Furthermore, most Windows users have no simple method
to block such□attacks against their home box that they use to dial
directly into the□'net.
□□□□□□□□□When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn about□the
issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their
security□situation as they were when they were running Windows.
□□□□□□□□□People take the time to attend self defense and "street
smarts"□seminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect
themselves in□the Real World(tm).  They watch the news to find out if
there is a serial□rapist in town this week.  They lock their doors and
windows at night, and□turn on the alarm system to keep the burglers
out.
□□□□□□□□□Is it really to much to expect people to take the time to learn
the□relatively simple techniques (like editing out unneeded daemons
from□inetd.conf and their startup scripts, and configuring firewalling
like□IPChains) that will lock down their Linux box to keep the Script

This article was a good one.  Unfortunately most people missed the

felt□not just a little insulted by your claim that Caldera is one of
the□distributions that doesn't to anything about security.
□□□
You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of
Slackware:□``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of
security holes.''□This sentence enforces my suspicion that your article
is based much more□on dated stereotypes than real understading of what
goes on in the Linux□security area.
□□□
If you go back to some time around 95, I grant you that Linux
distributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS.
This,□and the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large
degree)□by bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux
security□resources--such as a the linux-security list.
□□□
Since then, most Linux distributors, including Caldera, have started
to□put a lot more emphasis on security. There is even a certain amount
of information sharing and coordination concerning security
issues□among Linux distributors.
□□□
I have personally audited most if not all setuid applications and a
number of network servers shipped with OpenLinux. Linux as a whole has
profited from this. And we're not the only Linux vendor trying to
address security problems proactively.
□□□□
Working in the security area myself I can on the other hand
understand□your apparent frustration. Making an operating system more
secure is an□uphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes
in integrating□software with their product (or they make choices you
consider a mistake).□Programmers insist on putting the same bugs into
their programs over and□over again (do a grep strcpy over the pine
sources one day). Many users□expect things to "just work" and don't
take security serious until they□get hacked.
□□□
However don't blame distribution maintainers for a problem that has
many□more facets--especially if your assignment of blame is based on
sloppy□research.
□□□
On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past
few□years--and while I agree that there's a long way to go, progress
will□depend at least as much on creating more secure software in the
first□place as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□we all know why he wrote this□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□by □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□sanityimp□□□□ - Jan 9th 2000 15:50:34□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□it wasnt to get publicity, or for his own ego. we all know he wrote

□□□□□□□□□I read this a few hours ago, but thought it best to hold any
comments□for awhile -- A while has passed.
□□□□□□□□□□First, I do not blame Mr. Lasser for this article.  Having experience□as
an editor of a small, international law enforcement journal... I
know□that the old adage "Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger" holds
no water□in the journalism business.  Mr. Covey... shame now, did we not
learn at□least one thing from the cinema classic "Real Genius"? □"Never forget to□check your references!"  (I think the kids still like it when
I "get down"□verbally).
□□□□□□□□□Mr Lasser, I note that you have made an attempt, albeit feeble,
but□what appears to be an attempt non the less at saying you are sorry?
□If□this was an apology... then I, as a card carrying Slacker, accept --
Thank□you.
□□□□□□□□□Now if I may make a comment or two?  I do not claim to know even
a□fraction of what you, MR. Lasser, know about computer security. □I only□started *tinkering* with computers in 1984 --  The majority of my
security□experience is more with MP5s than MD5.  But, as anyone who
knows me (or has□had the misfortune of finding my web site) knows, I
have made a real□dedication towards network security.
□□□□□□□□□I seem to have taken a different, I like to think more
practical,□approach to finding what flavor of Linux I would use for my
firewall and□secure OS base.  Rather than which distro was the most
popular and had the□most support, I chose the one that (IMO) needed the
least work: Slackware!  But that is not why I am writing, I hope to
offer a simple explanation that□seems too often missed -- Or,
misunderstood.  Anyway, this is what I have□picked up in the last couple
of decades...
□□□□□□□□□The notion that anyone can completely protect something is
silly...□noble, but silly.  There is no security panacea -- and look
closely at□those who claim to have it, odds are there little wagons
have the words□"snake oil" freshly painted over  on the sides.  It is
this sort of□thinking that drives a company to spend $180,000.00 on a
high-tech,□laminated steel door - mounted in hardened and reinforced
concrete & steel□frame and casement - featuring hinges and locksets
made of solid□unobtanium!  Then put that door between two windows made
of genuine□glass?
□□□□□□□□□This is the same rational that has System Administrators walking□around
touting their new mega buck, AI powered,
Super-Cyber-Crypt-Keeper□Software... while EVERY terminal (even the one
that customers can use in□the lobby) has a functional floppy drive!
(yes, I have seen this).
□□□□□□□□□Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended
time□line, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X).
□One□the left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time
before□it happens -- not if, rather when.  To the right of the event, is
the time□it will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the
loss.
□□□□□□□□□|-------------------------------(X)-----------|
□□□□□□□□□Security is any effort that moves the event (X) further to the
right,□in fact all effort should be to move the event as far as
possible to the□right -- in a perfect world, a security compromise is
only a threat until□it is discovered, after action and contingency
plans are already tested□and in place... negation is immediate.
□□□□□□□□□Sorry, I have rambled on for far too long now... I do respect you

turned□OFF is not one of them.  I've used both Slackware and Redhat and
I have to□do a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant
amount to□Slackware) to make them secure.  I don't clean inetd.conf ...
I shut off□inetd itself ... on many systems.  Every distribution should
leave every□service that could listen on a port or pipe turned off,
even lpd. □During□install, and at any time later, there can be the

the services should be□installed in such a way they are not running

□□□□□□□□□This would be to the best benefit of end users who have little or

is□well-suited to the Linux community.  As one of several student
Unix□sysadmins in the computer science department, I have to deal with
the same□types of things he does.  One of the reasons we've opted not to
go with□Linux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is
because (1) we□feel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable
and secure than□Linux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven
environment in which our□CS students can code.  This does not prevent
many attempts to exploit our□machines, however.  On the average, I spend
nearly twenty minutes *per□hour* scrounging through logs and checking
stats to ensure that my fellow□students are safe at what they do best
(coding).  This does not come at an easy price.  Since I'm only one of a
few□security-minded student sysadmins, I have to make sure that my
coworkers□are kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories

noticed that the irc□network EFNet seems to split a lot more often now

on□Slackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that."□□□□□□□□□
Simple Answer:□□□□□□□□□
"These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk;
they're□damaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every time□I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have to consider□Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can answer. These□distributions' total lack of concern with security is an embarrassment to□the entire Linux and Open-Source communities."□□□□□□□□□
"Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't
provide□security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a Web site,□a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these distributions not□because they necessarily need the security notices for themselves, but□because these distributions are ruining Linux's image not only with novice□users, but with the reporters and editors who shape managers' opinions on□whether Linux is a viable solution."
□□□□□□□□
[ Further I found this funny
□□□□□□□□□
"If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems
wouldn't□be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems have been□exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a year old,□and which has been patched nearly that long"

What "Linux" Distribution would a university be running? ]□□□□□□□□□
I believe the only thing that is going to hurt your reputation as a
linux□professional is not collecting the [current] facts before
commenting on□controversial items.
□□□□□□□□□
Yes of course I am bias towards Slackware. It is in my opinion the
best□distribution. I have used Debian, RedHat and Stampede along some
of the□BSD flavors. I am not going to say Slackware is the most secure
Linux, but□that is only because I agree with the comment about the
administrators□being the security. As far as getting a distribution
secure in a short□amound of time, Slackware is darn good.
□□□□□□□□□
Recently a RedHat loving (Once Slackware despising) friend of my'n
was□amazed at how easy slackware is to configure ( without all the junk
in the□way ) and has since changed distributions. Slackware is quite
offten□smashed and bashed. It seems mostly by people who either haven't
used it,□or NEED a GUI with pretty pictures to run a computer.
□□□□□□□□□
You are in the position to influcence people. Obtaining an article on
a□major open source / linux site. It is your responsibility to at least
know□what products / projects you are telling people to "abandon".
□□□□□□□□□
"I certainly hope (and to some degree expect) that this situation's
been□cleaned up by now, but this made it impossible to audit slackware's□security if you wanted to." Well why don't you try it out
before the next□time you go publicly trashing it! I certainly hope (and

point.  All major distributions which I'm aware of come out of the box
with too□many services enabled, and too many potential holes for new
users to cope□with. They could all use a front-end script or dialogue
which would ask□new users what actually needs to be enabled, and then
disable everything□else by default.  I would rather assume that users
who need the services□will need to learn enough about the process to be
able to enable them□themselves anyway.
□□□□□□□□□The author makes a good point that if newbie users start
having□security problems all over the place because services they know
nothing□about and could care less about are enabled by default, this
could have a□detrimental impact on the Linux community in general with
bad press if,□for example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users
become mail relays□and stop-over points.
□□□□□□□□□I've used a number of the major distributions, and to my knowledge□they
are all guilty of this. They should come out of the box with
all□services disabled by default.
□□□□□□□□□The users who need these services will do the necessary research (it□is
hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and
to□keep on top of security advisories etc.  But you can't expect
everyone who□just wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it
all.

mistakes□concerning slackware.
□□□□□□□□□□The point being made was, a lot of people use linux that do NOT
have□time to, or even understand how to, secure their systems. Its
exactly the□same with other more mainstream OSs - I know of several ppl
who claim to□be NT admins, and yet dont even know where the MS security
websites are.
□□□□□□□□□Sure, when I install a linux system I go through and clean out
inetd,□add a decent ipchains firewall if appicable, and upgrade all the
packages□that I know have security flaws.
□□□□□□□□□Does Jane Bloggs who just installed a redhat 6.0 (or *any* system)
to□act as their companies dialup networking server and webserver know
how to□do this?□□□□□□□□□□□Would she know what cron *was*, much less that the redhat 6.0
rpm□happened to have a buffer overflow in it? (I think it was rh6.0
anyway)
□□□□□□□□□Would she know what the significance of inetd.conf is, much less how□to
secure it?
□□□□□□□□□□My take on the original article was not a dig at any particular
linux□distribution - but a point about the level of education out
there. And,□hand in hand with education, we have ease of accessability.
□□□□□□□□□□Half an hour a day, or even 5 minutes a day, might be enough to
cover□the headlines of bugtraq and a vendor-specific security mailing
list, but□someone telling Jane that she needed to upgrade her cron
package because□of a nasty buffer overflow which could give root access
wont mean a thing□unless□□□□□□□□
Jane knows if she uses the package
□□□□□□
Jane knows if its relevant
□□□□□□
Jane knows *how* to upgrade - be it installing a new rpm / deb,
or□grabbing a source tarball, applying the relative patches, and
compiling□it
□□□□□□□□□I think there are a lot of people who use linux, because of the
hype□surrouding it, who dont know what they are doing.
□□□□□□□□□In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or
less□secure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like
buffer□overruns in packages etc.  Why do you need to telnet into a
workstation?□disable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap?
www? disable it. If□the user needs it, they can set it up themselves.
They need to learn.
□□□□□□□□□Similar sort of tactics should be taken on a server distribution.
□□□□□□□□□□Oh no, people will cry, that will make it too hard! No one will
use□linux if its too hard!
□□□□□□□□□□Education....
□□□□□□□□□We dont need distributions that do everything for us - unless we□rolled
it ourselves, and know what it does. What we do need is information□on
*how* to secure it.
□□□□□I thought the Bastille project was a good idea (although i
never□actually used it). Things like this need to be fostered and
encouraged.
□□□□□□□□□□We currently have screeds of disjoint man pages, HOWTOs which
dont□agree with your distribution (most of the ones i've read appear to
work□with slackware, and bear no relevance to redhat), and
package-supplied□readmes that can also bear no resemblance to your
distribution-patched□binaries.
□□□□□□□□□I make a generalisation above, I know. But we need more
distribution□specific information on how to do these things.
□□□□And it needs to be centralised, and put in a 'to-do' list so that
new□users can *find* it easily enough.
□□□□□□□□□Hmm. I could have spent the time it took writing this, to instead□write
a redhat-specific HOWTO's on securing your workstation by locking□down
inetd, and checking for recent rpm updates.

One□things for certain though, Slackware does have less exploits released for□each of there distributions.
□□□□□□□□□Finaly, the only thing I have to say is I appriciate these fourms, it□gives us a chance to hear opinions from lots of people on security and not□just one persons views. □I think the only reason that Jon has recieved so□much flaming on his editorial is because he didn't take the time to think□that before you judge something you should use it your self. □Many people□are opinionated on which Linux system people should use, as hard as that□is to believe, and tend to take things to the extreme when someone makes□comment on it. □I guess in a sense I am one of those people as well, but□as I have used Red Hat, Debian, OpenBSD, SCO, Solaris, and many other *nix□oses, I feel that my decision in a *nix OS is an educated decision.

One□things for certain though, Slackware does have less exploits released for□each of there distributions.
□Finaly, the only thing I have to say is I appriciate these fourms, it□gives us a chance to hear opinions from lots of people on security and not□just one persons views. □I think the only reason that Jon has recieved so□much flaming on his editorial is because he didn't take the time to think□that before you judge something you should use it your self. □Many people□are opinionated on which Linux system people should use, as hard as that□is to believe, and tend to take things to the extreme when someone makes□comment on it. □I guess in a sense I am one of those people as well, but□as I have used Red Hat, Debian, OpenBSD, SCO, Solaris, and many other *nix□oses, I feel that my decision in a *nix OS is an educated decision.

□□□□□□□□□□□□
Can you _really_ make a system secure?

Can you _really_ build a foolproof out-of-the-box
linux□distribution that is secure without the user knowing what (s)he
is doing□("linux for dummies")?

OpenBSD is AFAIK considered one of the most secure OSs
available.□How much time do you expect a sys admin to invest in system

□□□□You are wrong. Period.
□□□□□□□□□I am a linux advocate. not a Slackware or Debian or Redhat or
*linux□advocate. Your blatent disregard for the facts is □normal . □No one seems□to care to research a liltle before going off on some rant
about some□information they know very little about. You aparently
didn't even bother□to email the heads of the distros to get a little
info. You just went off□saying how your selected distro's security was
the best... here are a few□examples.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
You mention "no official tool for automatic update."
□□□□By automatic do you mean... gets the patches and installs for you,
you□get the patches (some format. rpm, deb,slack tgz, whatever) and it
auto□installs? what? If you want a deamon to install patches for you
over the□internet, you dont know the first thing about security.
□□□□□□□□□□□
your computer desides its time to check for updates.
□□□□□□□□□□□
I hacked your local nameserver to point (whatever).(whatever) at
my□box, and set up an package distrobution server for whatever client
is used□in whatever distro. you resolve to me and get a backdoored
in.telnetd or□whatever. boom. your rooted.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□
"Slackware Linux "
□□□□□□□□□"No known web page for security "
□□□□try: ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-7.0/patches/
□□□□There are all the patches. the Changelog.txt file tells you what
they□are and why you would need them.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□"No known mail list for security"
□□□□Maybe if you went to www.slackware.com and clicked the little
"mailing□lists" link you would see the slackware-security and
slackware-anounce□lists. even avalible in journal form!
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
"No known tool for security updates"
□□□□There are several ways to do it.
□□□□installpkg [pkgname]
□□□□pkgtool
□□□□□□□□□here again "Forgive them Father... they know not what they do..."
□□□□□□□□□You tell people to abandon linux distros based on your lies.
Aparently□you say... screw everything else... Get Redhat (top of the
list), Debian,□SuSe or Mandrake.
□□□□□□□□□You say those "other" distros damage linux's credability... You
damage□linux's credability. You make blatently wrong statments out of
lack of□knowledge and lack of desire to research an article before
making a fool□out of yourself.
□□□□OK
□□□□Enough
□□□□□□□□□Sorry for the length of this comment. Had to get it out.
□□□□As for the other distros which I am sure our friend Jon
Lasser□wronged... someone else defend them. I only use slackware, and
dont know□much about other distros other than redhat, caldera, and
mandrake.

Perhaps half an hour a day was a bit too much for the average person.□10minutes would work just as
well
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If it takes more than 5 minutes a month, it's not going to get done.

Really, non-hackers just can't be bothered with this kind of stuff.

That's why, if you want to improve the overall security of the net and
the□reputation of Linux as a whole, you need to secure it at the
source: the□distributions need to be more secure by default, and it
needs to be□possible for installations to remain secure without the end
users having□to spend any brainpower on it at all.  Because they just
won't.

secure□distrobution" around.  This is in fact not true, and neather is
saying□"Redhat is the most secure" or Debian or Caldera, or any
distrobution or□Operating system.  Even your linux box in the corner of
your office with a□static ip, with just telnet and ftp services
running, and all the latest□patches you can think of put on it; is ALOT
less secure then if you pull□out the ethernet wire.  In this day and age
there is no "most secured"□linux distrobution. There is always
something else you can do to make it□just a little more secure.
□□□□□□□□□All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the
people□who released the distrobution.  Which means in fact, that
hundreds of□different programs, written by hundreds of different people
are on the□same computer.  Thos will also mean that there is a very
likely chance□that one or more of those programs will have security
problems. □And I am□not just talking about Linux, or just Unix in
general.  Look at Windows 95□98 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of
programmers work on them, from□one major company, and there was a
mistake in codeing that caused remote□users to be able to disconnect
them from the internet.  Something like□that could happen in the linux
world also, a popularly used program that□has a tragic flaw.
□□□□□□□□□Personally though, as many other people have said, when
first□installing any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up
inetd.conf□disableing services that arent needed. Slackware is the same
way, along□with other problems. So you can't say that out of the box
Slackware is the□most secure, because it just plain isn't. Neather is
anything.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Touche..□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□by □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jihad□□□□ - Jan 8th 2000 15:26:07□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□"But if I can't hold someone to past mistakes, how can I judge

on□the net. Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the

that Red Hat□releases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's
possible to secure□the system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion.□□□□□□□□□But that only answers half the question: so now I know why people
take□Slackware to be the target (because I made a mistake which gave
them a□foothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's

I□□□□□swear□□□□□ I went to the site and looked around before claiming not to□find
anything, but somehow I still made a mistake.□□□□□□□□□I can't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7,
as□I've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security
holes in□Red Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of
problems with Red□Hat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem)
have been bugs in the□underlying code, not particularly related to
either of those distributions.□If those bugs aren't present in
Slackware, that's either because those□packages weren't included in
Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point of□fact) or because Slackware
fixed those bugs before anyone else knew about□them and failed to
backpropogate the fixes. I don't think it's the□latter.□□□□□□□□□In the old days (pre 7.0, maybe another level back beyond that or so,
I□can't remember the last version I used), Slackware had □□□□huge□□□□□□numbers of
security holes. They just ignored them. And the sources never□seemed to
be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimes□it was
obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as
the□compiler would spew errors. I certainly hope (and to some degree
expect)□that this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it impossible□to audit slackware's security if you wanted to.□□□□□□□□□But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack on□Slackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that. I□certainly think that Slackware's record on security could
stand□improvement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found
and fixed□bugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux
distribution□-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't
about any□particular distribution.□□□□□□□□□What it is about is why security □□□□is□□□□□ important, even if you□personally
can handle yourself. Claiming otherwise is kind of like□claiming that
ISO9660 filesystem support in Linux isn't worth keeping in□the kernel
simply because you personally don't use it: it's a
fundamental,□enabling feature of the environment for any number of
users.□□□□□□□□□It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media,
and□simple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally
don't□care who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But I need
Linux to□look good in the media, so that I can push for it in
appropriate projects□at work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for
Linux in the media makes it□more attractive for companies (ie Creative
Labs) to write open-source□drivers for hardware which is nice to play
with. :-)□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Slackware security□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□by □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Jihad□□□□ - Jan 8th 2000 13:32:01□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□Is it just me or does this "professional" not know what hes talking

Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out
there.□Patrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things
with the□4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than I have seen him do in years (since the
2.x days). I□dont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com
came into□existance... the quality of the Slackware machines I dealt
with seemed to□increase also. I dealt with too many people with hacked
Slack95 boxes with□exploits that had been around way too long. Going to
the cdrom.com site□usually had out of date info. Now I see a central
site and people find□things rapidly and cleanly.
□□□□□□□□
I used to use slackware up until 1996 when I switched to Red Hat
because I□was tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was
"Well patch it□and compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next
release"... which□never came. When I found them in Red Hat, I saw an
RPM at a central spot.
□□□□□□□□□□□□
Now is Red Hat perfect? □□□□□□□□NO□□□□□□□□□. There are bugs and it could□always tighten
things up here or there. However I know every time a change□is made to
tighten security up... there are howls of "Why did you
change□this/that." The same is true for SuSE, Caldera, etc. You get
slammed no□matter what you do because a) people hate change, and b)
people like to□whine versus deal.
□□□□□□□□
Anyway back to the main point.. which is what is the problem. The
problem□is that Linux is not for System Administrators anymore□□□□□□□□□!GASP!□□□□□□□□□.
Sorry most of the people who are using Linux□probably know only enough
system administration to start a modem and stop□a modem... and that may
be a stretch.  And that is what you get for having□an open community and
saying things like "Stop using Microsoft... use□something better...
also we are a community versus an elitist club like□XYZbsd, etc." (Not
saying BSD is elitist, just a very common argument I□hear about why
Linux is better).
□□□□□□□□
Most people use computers as an ends to a means as JWZ said. They use
them□to browse web sites, answer email, write documents and letters,
scan□pictures in for a family album. The computer to them is nothing
more than□a tool.. as much as the car gets them to and from work.
□□□□□□□□
With this being the case, and being that we are supposed to be a
better OS□and a better community... we need to make sure that we have a
better□attitude towards security. I dont feel boycotts are needed.

distros do seem to have□server written all over them, but that doesn't
really seem to be the□market they're trying to hit lately.  Some

That
should be□the job of the system administrator(s). End users have more
important□things to do (as far as the company is concerned) than
monitoring patches□for their OS. If the system administrator doesn't
know where to look for□security advisories and patches, then maybe it's
time to find a new system□administrator. I am not a system
administrator. I'm one of those geeks at□the company that brings in
money on contracts. I have enough things to do□at work that I don't
need the added burden of duplicating the work of my□company's system
administrators (no matter how bad they may be).
□□□□□□□□□That being said, I also have to agree with Nicko Acks in that
Linux□distrobutions turn too many services on by default. Heaven forbid
someone□should take the better route and leave everything off to begin
with (like□OpenBSD) and then let the system admininstrator turn on only
the services□he needs.□□□□□□□□□□□Having many distros may be a plus, in some ways, but it's also
a□definite minus too, considering that the (potential) user needs
to□consider the pros and cons of each (or just run out and buy the
newest□version of Red Hat like most people these days :p). And
significant energy□is wasted duplicating efforts to keep patches up to
date.

□□□□same problem that I have faced with many commercial unix's: they
□□□□have too many services turned on by default that are not needed.
□□□□One of the bigest things that would be a help for security is that
□□□□distributions go to a policy where installed software is only turned
□□□□on when explicitly asked for rather than on by default. □While this□□□□□□will not□ stop everything, it would stop a good portion of the new
□□□□□machines out there getting broken into right away.
□□□□□□□□□□□One thing comes to mind.  Why does every linux distribution need
□□□□to be server oriented?  I think there is a real need out there for
□□□□a completely client-side distribution.  This would take care of
□□□□□the extra services problem by making sure that servers are not
□□□□even an option.
□□□□□□□□□□□Another issue that I think distributions should look into is finding
□□□□a way to more easily distribute patches. □ While it is a good thing
□□□□□that to have fixes come out quickly it is entire different problem
□□□□with getting users to actually apply them. □ I think the process of
□□□□□fixing bugs needs to be as simple as possible so that it can be
□□□□□as automated as possible (debian's app-get method for updating
□□□□software comes to mind). □ While this introduces even more possible
□□□□security risks I think that it should be concidered at least for the
□□□□new user.
