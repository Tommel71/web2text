□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Since many film types were only available from the film manufacturers
in□35mm stock, several submini camera manufacturers designed film
splitters□to allow cutting a smaller strip of film from 35mm stock.
With a film slitter,□you can get some amazing film into your submini,
such as 2475 recording film,□□□□□□□W or color infrared film, Tech pan,
Agfapan 25 and Ektar 25. □□□□□□Sometimes called film slitters -- and NOT to
be confused with film□SPLICERS -- these devices came in various styles
to cut different size strips.□Some cut a 35mm strip in half to produce
two 17.5mm strips for cameras that□used that size film. Others would
cut 16mm strips, 9.5mm strips and even□8mm strips. Some of the
companies that made these slitters were GaMi, Minolta,□Yashica, Ricoh,
Mikroma, Microtec, Acmel, and Varitype. There are undoubtedly□more.
They basically work the same way. Using razor blades, of some
type,□they cut out smaller strips of film from 35mm film. These items
are no longer□being made and are very difficult to find.

If you are handy or determined, you might even want to built your own
slitter.□All you need are a few small pieces of wood, a couple of razor
blades, some□basic tools, a little ingenuity and time. □□□□□□Here are some
pictures of□a completed splitter. With this slitter, you place a bulk
roll of 35mm film□on the part that looks like a black handle. The film
is pressed down onto□the cutting block and a removeable pressure plate
is screwed on top. Then□the film is pulled through the slitter and
rolled up on the other side. Two□pieces of felt on either side of the
film keep it from getting scratched.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
You can use various materials in the construction of your slitter.
□□□□□□The□decision on material is up to you. □□□□□□Wood is normally easier to
work□with if you just have standard tools, but other materials may
offer advantages,□if you are familiar with them and have the necessary
tools. □□□□□□In building□your own slitter, one big problem you will come
across is that the film is□measured in millimeters, but American
building materials are normally cut□in inches. To complicate matters
even more, when you add in the razor blades□inbetween the wood blocks,
the width is increased very slighly, but it can□be enough to through
off careful measurements. Here are some helpful□measurements:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
3/8" wood = .375 inches = 9.525mm -- A piece of wood this thick
will need □□□ to be sanded down somewhat to produce the size of the
Minox film (9.2mm).
□□□□□□□□□□
5/8" wood = .625 inches = 15.875mm -- A piece of wood this thick
(plus the □□□ added thickness of the razor blade) should be just right
for 16mm film.
□□□□□□□□□□
11/16" wood = .6875 inches = 17.4625mm -- A piece of wood this
thick (plus □□□ the added thickness of the razor blade) should be just
right for 17.5mm film.
□□□□□□□□□□
1 3/8" wood = 1.375 inches = 34.925mm -- Pieces of wood that total
to this □□□ thickness (plus the added thicknesses of the razor blades)
should be just □□□ right for the total width of the 35mm film.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you need just a little extra spacing, pieces of construction
paper will □□□ probably work fine. □□□□□□If you need a little less spacing,
sand down the □□□ wood with fine sand paper, measuring as you go.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Here are a few diagrams to use depending on the type and size of film
you□plan to slit. □□□□□□The diagrams are NOT to scale.□□□□□□□□□
If you are using □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□35mm unperforated□film□□□□.□□□□
If you are using □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□standard 35mm perforated□film□□□□.□□□□
If you are using □□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□16mm film, regardless of□the perforations□□□□.□□□□□□□□□
You can see from these diagrams is that if you only use one size of
film□to slit from (ex. 35mm) and one size of film to slit to (ex. 16mm)
your job□will be easier. □□□□□□If you plan on slitting from different film
sizes (ex.□35mm AND 16mm), or slit to different film sizes (ex. 16mm
AND 9.5mm) your□work is more involved. □□□□□□You will need to make different
film slitters□or make a slitter with different slitting block pieces.
□□□□□□It's up to□you to decide which is the best route to take.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
Before you get started, here are few points to ponder.
□□□□□□□□□□
Making a slitter takes time even if you are familiar with hand tools.
□□□□□□The□measurements must be precise and the pieces of material are small,
making□cutting difficult. □□□□□□It also makes it easy to cut yourself, so
watch□out!□□□□
The more planning you do up front the better your results will be and
the□easier the job will be. □□□□□□The plans outlined here are generic plans
and□need to be modified depending on the type of film you plan to slit,
the type□of film you want to produce, the type of materials you plan to
use and the□features you want to built into the slitter. □□□□□□You will
first need to□spend time designing your slitter using these diagrams as
a starting point. □□□□□□If you have trouble designing your slitter, it's
best not to build□one yourself.
□□□
The amount of wood used in the project is very small. □□□□□□Becasue of
this□you can probably afford to move up from a soft wood, like pine, to
a harder□wood, like oak. □□□□□□Your slitter will last longer, but your saws
and drill□bits won't. □□□□□□Harder woods are trickier to work with.
□□□□□□□□□□
The SUBCLUB can assume no responsibility for the success of your
splitter,□nor for any damage you do to yourself or your camera during
its construction□or use. □□□□□□ In other words, you're on your own. □□□□□□If you have the□slightest doubt about building a slitter, you probably
shouldn't built one.
□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
If you are working with wood, the tools you will need are:□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
electric drill and bits
□□□□□□□□□□
screwdriver
□□□□□□□□□□□hammer□□□□□□□□□□□

□□□□□□□□□□□pliers
□□□□□□□□□□□ruler
□□□□□□□□□□□pencil□□□□□□□□□□
The materials you will need will vary depending on size of the slitter
you□make and the design and features you build into it.□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□□
wood (see diagram to design and measure your own pieces)
□□□□□□□□□□
screws (flat head will probably work best)
□□□□□□□□□□
bolts (there are several kinds available)
□□□□□□□□□□
wing nuts (to go with the bolts)
□□□□□□□□□□
washers (to go under the wing nuts)
□□□□□□□□□□
felt (available at any fabric store)
□□□□□□□□□□
dowels (depending on your plans)
□□□□□□□□□□
razor blades (many types are available)
